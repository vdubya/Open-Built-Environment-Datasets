PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  This note may be disregarded for regions where Alkali-Silica Reactivity 
(ASR) is not a concern. Some aggregate sources may exhibit an ASR potential.  
ASR is a potentially deleterious reaction between alkalis present in concrete 
and some siliceous aggregates, reference EM 1110-2-2000 paragraph 2-3b(6) and 
appendix D.  Where ASR is known or suspected to pose a concern for concrete 
durability, it is recommended that aggregates proposed for use in concrete be 
evaluated to determine ASR potential and an effective mitigation.  EM 1110-2-2000, 
provides recommendations for evaluating and mitigating ASR in concrete mixtures.  
Aggregate evaluations may not be practical for projects requiring small quantities 
of concrete (less than<MET> 200 cubic meters</MET><ENG> 250 cubic yards</ENG>).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> CONCRETE PAVING FOR AIRFIELDS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY PAVEMENTS, 
paragraph 2.3.1.2 Alkali-Silica Reactivity, provides a specification method 
for the Contractor to evaluate and mitigate ASR in concrete mixtures.  The expansion 
limits specified in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> are requirements for pavements and exterior 
slab construction.  For structural concrete applications the measured expansion 
shall be less than 0.10 percent.  It may not be economical or practical to specify 
different test limit requirements for use on the same project.  In which case 
the lower limit required by the application should be used.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The designer may use the specification method in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> by incorporating 
the relevant paragraphs into this specification, or may use the following requirements

be moved horizontally during a placing operation, except that as the required height is reached, the tremie pipes

control representatives and results plotted as tests are made.  When a single slump test reaches or goes beyond 
either the upper or lower action limit, a second test shall immediately be made on the same batch of concrete.  
The results of the two tests shall be averaged and this average used as the slump of the batch to plot on the

limit shall be set at<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> below the maximum allowable slump on separate control charts for percent 
air used for each type of mixture as specified in subparagraph SLUMP of 1.3 'f', and upper and lower action limit

.  Capacity of barrels shall not exceed<MET> 4.6 m</MET><ENG> 15 feet</ENG> of core, and they shall be equipped with diamond-set core 
bits and standard core lifters.  Supplies for core drilling shall include all casing, drill rods, core barrels, 
diamond-set coring bits, piping, pumps, water, tools, core boxes, and power required for drilling.  Bits shall 
be set with the proper size stones for drilling the concrete and bed rock.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Core Boxes</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Longitudinally partitioned wooden core boxes constructed of dressed lumber or other approved materials in general 
accordance with arrangement and dimensions shown in the drawing included at the end of this section of the specifications 
shall be used for all cores.  As many core boxes as may be required shall be used in submitting each concrete 
or rock core or group of cores.  Core boxes shall be completely equipped with all necessary partitions, covers, 
hinges, and hasps for holding down the cover.  To prevent undue core breakage (while it is being placed in boxes) 
and to allow for ease of access to core in the specified core boxes, the maximum amount of core to be placed 
in any one box shall be determined by the Government core drill inspector during the drilling operations.  Normally, 
it is expected that an average of approximately<MET> 3.7 m</MET><ENG> 12 feet</ENG> of core can be placed in each box.  In addition 
to the spacer blocks shown in the drawing, provide, as required, lengths of<MET> 29 by 54 mm</MET><ENG> 1-1/8 by 2-1/8 inch</ENG> wood, 
painted red on one side, which shall be cut into<MET> 100 mm</MET><ENG> 4-inch</ENG> lengths, marked with appropriate depths, and inserted 
in the proper positions in core boring samples to show the location and actual extent of voids and core losses.  
Mark all core boxes with the appropriate hole number, box number, and depths.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Disposition of Core Samples</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Upon completion of core drilling and sampling operations for each hole, core boxes containing cores shall be 
delivered to a storage facility to be designated at the project site.  Core boxes containing cores shall be delivered 
in accordance with schedules prepared by the Contracting Officer.  All packing, handling, and transportation 
of samples shall be considered as subsidiary obligations of the Contractor.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Backfilling Core Holes</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Upon completion of core sampling, the holes shall be backfilled under gravity pressure with portland cement grout 
or mortar as directed by the Contracting Officer.  The grout shall be pumped into the hole through drill rods 
or plastic hose set to within<MET> 1.5 m</MET><ENG> 5 feet</ENG> of the bottom of the hole.  The bottom of the core hole is defined 
as being a point in bedrock<MET> 900 mm</MET><ENG> 3 feet</ENG> below the bottom of the panel or the point at which the boring deviates 
from the cutoff wall.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
</SPT><SPT><TTL>Evaluation and Acceptance</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Concrete will be evaluated by examination of cores drilled by the Contractor from completed panels as specified 
in paragraph CORING CONCRETE IN COMPLETED PANELS in PART 1, and unacceptable concrete is defined in paragraph 
UNACCEPTABLE CONCRETE IN COMPLETED PANELS.  Concrete determined to be unacceptable shall be repaired or removed 
and replaced as specified in paragraph CONCRETE PLACEMENT above.</TXT><BRK/>

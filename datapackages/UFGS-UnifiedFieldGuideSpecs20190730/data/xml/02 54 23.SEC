<NPR>NOTE:  This UFGS provides the framework for developing a project-specific soil 
washing specification.  It should be modified as necessary for a given site, 
to incorporate the conditions, soil washing technology, and regulatory requirements 
which are specific to the site.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The appropriate regulatory agencies should be consulted to obtain their approval 
of work plans, specifications, drawings, and on the sampling methodology for 
a soil washing treatment project.  The maximum allowable quantity of the treated 
materials or the process sludge from which one composite sample must be taken 
for characterization and/or compliance should also be verified.  This maximum 
allowable quantity per composite sample collection may effect the size of a 
stockpile, and subsequently, determine the number of days required to reach 
this quantity based on the daily generation of the treated materials or the 
process sludge.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The soil washing operation considered in this section starts with the raw contaminated 
material piles; continues through preparation, feeding, washing, separation, 
stockpiling, waste (solid, liquid and/or gaseous) treatment and disposal; ends 
at the treated clean material piles.  Refer to Section <SRF>02 61 13</SRF> EXCAVATION AND 
HANDLING OF CONTAMINATED MATERIAL for requirements related to excavation of 
the contaminated materials and redeposition (or backfilling) of the treated 
clean materials.  Refer to Section <SRF>02 81 00</SRF> TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS 
MATERIALS for requirements relevant to offsite transportation and disposal.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Additional references from Federal, state, and local regulatory requirements; 
utility company regulations; and applicable codes and standards published by 
scientific and engineering institutions should be included where appropriate

<BRK/>
<TXT>Soil washing and separation system must include mixing, washing, [solids and liquid separation] [particle size

<NPR>NOTE:  This paragraph should be deleted if removal of contaminants is not dependent 
upon separation of contaminated fine particles (i.e., entirely due to solubilization 
or other removal techniques).  This paragraph provides options for either the 
design engineer to specify or the Contractor to choose the cut size requirements.  
The feed materials at a given site may have different physical and chemical 
characteristics.  Therefore, during soil washing treatment, different cut sizes 
may be used so that the treated materials will meet the post treatment criteria.  
If the design engineer chooses to specify the cut size and if treatment involves 
a variety of cut sizes, then the different cut sizes should be specified for 
different feed materials in this paragraph.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>Cut size is the targeted grain size used to define the demarcation of the coarse and fine fractions of the feed 
materials to be separated during the soil washing operation.  [The feed materials must be treated to meet the 
post treatment criteria by using a cut size of no greater than [_____] micron in the soil washing treatment.] 
[Each cut size must be based on the treatability study results so that the treated materials will meet the post 
treatment criteria with minimum generation of process sludge.  Each selected cut size with supporting documentation 
must be submitted for review prior to implementation.  The supporting document must include information correlating 
contaminant concentrations for the various size fractions based on the grain size distribution.]</TXT><BRK/>

<NPR>If a performance specification is prepared, the treatment and disposal requirements

<NPR>Spent washwater should be characterized to determine whether it constitutes 
a RCRA hazardous waste in accordance with RCRA Identification and Listing of 
Hazardous Wastes or applicable state regulations.  The "derived-from" rule requires 
treatment residues from the treatment of RCRA listed waste to be managed as 
listed waste.  If the spent washwater is classified as a hazardous waste, a 
determination should be made as to whether additional treatment is required 
to comply with LDRs.  In addition, the requirements in RCRA Standards for Generators 
of Hazardous Waste and applicable state regulations should be identified and 
satisfied.</NPR><BRK/>

be mentioned in this paragraph.  These wastewaters may include, for example, 
the rainfall run offs from the stockpiles of feed oversize, feed materials,

treatment of feed oversize, process sludge, and/or spent process treatment material.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  When temperature is below the freezing point, the treatment plant equipment 
may not function properly or efficiently.  Frozen materials can make excavation, 
conveying, screening, and blending operations difficult and less cost-effective.  
The general practice is to avoid the operation of an outdoor treatment plant 
during the extreme winter weather.  In places where there is a long winter season 
or in projects where the plant operation is required throughout the year to 
meet the project schedule, it may be necessary to perform soil washing inside 
a temporary building with proper heating and ventilation.  Use of UFGS should 
address only the minimal requirements to satisfy the temporary construction.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The treatment plant must not be operated during periods when temperatures reach freezing or below [unless operated 
in a structure].  Do no perform soil washing during periods of heavy rainfall if this will interfere with the 
effective operation of the treatment plant.  The main control center must have the necessary provisions for heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning for proper operation of the instruments, controls, and electronic data storage 
system.  The treatment plant must be equipped with sufficient lighting for security purposes and for treatment 
plant operation during inadequate daylight or at night.  [Refer to Section <SRF>23 00 00</SRF> AIR SUPPLY, DISTRIBUTION,

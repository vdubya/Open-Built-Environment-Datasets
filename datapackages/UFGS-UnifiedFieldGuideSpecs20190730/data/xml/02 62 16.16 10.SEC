<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Commissioning is performed after construction has been completed, and 
is an ordered process for testing and start-up of SVE system equipment.  During 
commissioning, pre-commissioning checklists are completed, and functional performance 
tests are performed to test individual components of the system and subsystems.  
Demonstration serves as a prove-out period.  The purpose of the demonstration 
is to show that the SVE system, as a whole, is ready to be put into service.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This guide specification should be used in conjunction with Section 
<SRF>02 62 16.13 10</SRF> OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND PROCESS MONITORING FOR SOIL VAPOR 
EXTRACTION SYSTEMS.  For small-scale SVE projects, editing and combining this 
section with Section <SRF>02 62 16.13 10</SRF> should be considered.  Additional guidance 
on start-up of SVE systems can be found in EM 1110-1-4001 SOIL VAPOR EXTRACTION 
AND BIOVENTING.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This guide specification should be coordinated with other sections that may 
also include commissioning requirements for SVE system components, to avoid 
unnecessary duplication of requirements.</NPR><BRK/>

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  If there is a separate Price and Payment Procedures Section, edited versions 
of these paragraphs should be inserted in that section.  Coordinate these paragraphs 
with the bidding schedule.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Separate, lump sum prices are generally recommended for Baseline Monitoring, 
Commissioning, and Demonstration.  However it is also recommended that bidders 
be required to provide unit cost amounts for laboratory testing for chemical 
data.  Unit costs will provide a basis for negotiating for additional tests, 
if determined that more testing than was originally anticipated is required.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
It is recommended that the bid sheet be structured so that a portion of the 
payment (i.e., at least 30 percent) for construction of the SVE system be withheld 
at least until the full-scale demonstration has been completed.  If acceptance 
of the SVE system is granted before the bugs are worked out, there may not be 
sufficient incentive for the Contractor to finish fixing problems with the SVE 
system.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Commissioning and demonstration of the full-scale SVE system should be 
preceded by a pilot-scale demonstration.  The pilot-scale demonstration (or 
field demonstration) is usually the last step of the design investigation.  
Data gained during the pilot-scale demonstration are critical to proper sizing 
of the blower and other process equipment, and to proper lateral and vertical 
placement of SVE wells.  This section only addresses commissioning and demonstration 
for full-scale SVE systems.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The specifications for the treatment system, or for components of the treatment 
system, should include requirements for testing, adjusting and balancing.  Blowers, 
motors and air handling components of the SVE system should be tested in accordance 
with Section <SRF>23 05 93</SRF> TESTING, ADJUSTING, AND BALANCING OF HVAC SYSTEMS prior 
to commissioning.  Although Section <SRF>23 05 93</SRF> is oriented primarily toward HVAC 
systems, the same testing, adjusting, and balancing requirements should be applied 
to components of the SVE system.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

site remediation under CERCLA authority does not require federal, state or local 
permits.  This includes all NPL and non-NPL sites being remediated under CERCLA

For SVE System Piping</THD><BRK/>
<BRK/>
  1.  Functional Performance Test:  Verify operation of the SVE system piping in accordance with specification.  
The following items are required to be verified while the blower is operating:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
      a. Check vacuum response at each SVE wellhead before and after valving on each well.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
      b. With the valves to all SVE wells in the open positions, gradually modulate the inlet bleed valve from fully 
open position, adjusting toward the fully closed position.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
      c. As wells are valved on, leak-test joints not previously tested.  Also leak-test accessible portions of SVE 
wells and pressure monitoring points.  Note the locations of any leaks.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
  2.  If piping system includes drainage points, check for water at drainage points at the end of each day during commissioning.  <BRK/>
<BRK/>
  3.  Conduct Independent measurement of air flow rates (from each extraction well, and total extraction airflow 
rate) alongside TAB specialist.  Ensure results differ by no more than 10 percent. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
  4.  Verify operation of heat tracing.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
  5.  Certification:  We the undersigned have witnessed the above functional performance tests and certify that the 
item tested has met the performance requirements in this section of the specifications.<BRK/>

For Vapor Stream Treatment Unit:  [_____]</THD><BRK/>
<BRK/>
  1.  Functional Performance Test:  Verify operation of the Vapor Stream Treatment System in accordance with specification.  
Verify the following while the system is operating:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
      a.  Check inlet and outlet connections for any signs of leaks.  Note the locations of any leaks.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
      b.  Check airflow rates at inlet and outlet of vapor stream treatment system:<BRK/></TBL>

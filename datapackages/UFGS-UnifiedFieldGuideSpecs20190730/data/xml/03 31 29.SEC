<STL>MARINE CONCRETE WITH SERVICE LIFE MODELING</STL><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE: This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>reinforced concrete 
exposed to marine and chloride environments for projects with a defined service 
life</SCP>.  In addition, use this guide specification for projects with concrete 
exposed to weather in locations with Environmental Severity Classifications 
(ESC) of C4 and C5 and where deicing salts are used on the structure, where 
service life modeling is appropriate.  See UFC 1-200-01 for determination of 
the ESC for project locations.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The defined service life approach mandates that the Government define the service 
life expectations of the structure (in years) prior to design.  This document 
is a combination of prescriptive and performance based specifications.  It contains 
specific requirements for quality control (actions taken by the Contractor) 
and quality assurance (actions that may be taken by the Government).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This guide specification includes provisions for performing concrete service 
life modeling.  If it is determined that concrete service life modeling is not 
required for the project, then Section <SRF>03 31 30</SRF> Marine Concrete (without Service 
Life Modeling) should be used.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>It is recommended that every significant structure employ service life modeling.  
Generally, significant structures are defined as having at least one of the 
following characteristics:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>o   Required Service Life: Greater than 60 years; or<BRK/>
<BRK/>
o   Volume of Concrete Works: Greater than 10,000 cubic yards; or<BRK/>
<BRK/>
o   Monetary Construction Value of the entire project: Greater than $15M; or<BRK/>
<BRK/>
o   Service life modeling is required by the Government.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For projects meeting the above criteria, enhanced durability is required, and 
therefore, a full service life modeling and durability assessment as described 
in the specification shall be performed.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Other criteria to consider when evaluating the applicability of service life 
design, and if Service Life Modeling is required, include:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>o   Mission Criticality based on the Mission Dependency Index (MDI) Score.  
For example, consider service life modeling for an MDI score higher than 54.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>o   Consequences of Failure:  Consider service life modeling for UFC 3-301-01 
Risk Categories IV or higher.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The performance-based portion of this document includes requirements to predict 
the service life of the candidate concrete mixtures prior to proceeding with 
construction.  During construction, concrete cylinders are made from the production 
concrete at intervals specified by the Engineer of Record to measure transport 
properties and for microscopic examination of the hardened concrete to verify 
that the concrete quality remains consistent and acceptable.  Conventional requirements 
for compressive strength and slump remain the same.  Service life modeling software 
is a tool that, when used in combination with other tools and good engineering 
judgment, enhances the Contractor's and Government's confidence that the completed 
structure will perform for the defined service life.  TR-NAVFAC ESC-CI-1215, 
the "Navy User's Guide to Quality Assurance of New Concrete Construction" provides 
a commentary for the user of this methodology.  Generally, this version of the 
marine concrete UFGS is for major projects.  For smaller marine concrete projects 
and for projects without a defined service life the Specifier can consider use 
of Section <SRF>03 31 30</SRF> MARINE CONCRETE that excludes service life modeling requirements 
and testing for transport properties during construction.</NPR><BRK/>

of a marine structure that are permanently buried in soil shall be considered marine concrete.  In addition, 
structures may need to be designed using these criteria even though they are not adjacent to the waterfront.  
For example, structures located several hundred yards from the waterfront often deteriorate prematurely

<NPR>NOTE:  Service Life Modeling</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Use of service life modeling predicts the performance of the concrete mixture 
when placed and cured properly.  Concrete sampling during production and (if 
necessary) from the completed structure provides additional data to predict 
the service life.  This methodology enhances the Navy's confidence that the 
structure will perform without major repairs for the defined service life.  
It is recommended that every significant structure employ this section inclusive 
of service life modeling.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Owner, the Engineer of Record, and/or the Contracting Officer shall determine 
if this approach is applicable. Additional information is provided in TR-NAVFAC 
ESC-CI-1215.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The goal is to provide quality concrete with the specified concrete cover to 
protect the steel, which provides the primary protection mechanism against chemical 
deterioration and corrosion related damage.  All other corrosion protection 
strategies are considered to be supplemental and include (but are not limited 
to): barrier coatings to the concrete surface, fusion-bonded epoxy-coated steel, 
corrosion inhibitors, galvanized, stainless, MMFX, Z-bar reinforcing and cathodic 
protection.  All of which may provide some life extension but by how much is 
considered to be speculation for real structures exposed to chloride environments.  
If the available materials in the region of the project are inadequate to meet 
the requirements for shrinkage, compressive strength, constructability and service 
life then the Contractor shall prepare a recommendation for review by the agency's 
Subject Matter Expert in Concrete Materials and approval by the Contracting 
Officer and Engineer of Record on a case-by-case basis to use supplemental corrosion 
protection to meet project requirements.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Two methodologies for predicting the service life of concrete structures are 
acceptable to the Navy: STADIUM® and the methodology described in <HL2>fib</HL2> Bulletin

<NPR>NOTE:  Navy waterfront structures typically take a year or more to complete.  
With time, all concrete continues to gain strength.  The Engineer of Record 
is encouraged to design the structural elements based on the compressive strength 
that will be achieved at 56 or 90 days rather than at 28 days.  Doing so will 
better allow the Contractor to develop and place concrete mixtures with less 
portland cement.  Excessive use of cement leads to more cracks and shorter-lived 
structures.  Embracing this approach will result in structures that are less 
expensive, greener, and more sustainable.</NPR><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">h.  Transport Properties if using STADIUM®: Determine ion transport properties of the concrete in accordance 
with test procedures outlined by SIMCO, maker of STADIUM® software.  Ion Transport properties are required 
as inputs for service life modeling and include: the volume of permeable voids (porosity); the ion diffusion 
coefficient (D<SBS>oh</SBS>); the moisture transport coefficient (MTC), and an aging factor.  A brief description 
of the test procedures is provided below.  See <RID>TR-NAVFAC ESC-CI-1215</RID> for further details.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(1) Porosity: The volume of permeable voids (porosity) of concrete is determined in accordance 
with <RID>ASTM C642</RID>.  Porosity is determined for qualification of concrete mixtures and for quality 
acceptance testing.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(2) Ion Diffusion Coefficient (D<SBS>oh</SBS>): This test is a modified version of <RID>ASTM C1202</RID> and uses 
an electrical field to migrate chloride ions through a vacuum saturated concrete specimen for 
approximately 14 days.  The electrical charge flowing through the concrete is related to the 
diffusion coefficient of ionic species in cementitious materials.  A test is defined as the 
average of two specimens run together and whose results are analyzed together to produce a single 
D<SBS>oh</SBS> value.  The service life modeling software uses the cementitious materials proportions and 
porosity measurements to analyze the electrical measurements and determine the D<SBS>oh</SBS>.  The D<SBS>oh</SBS> 
is determined for qualification of concrete mixtures and for quality acceptance testing.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(3) Moisture Transport Test: This modified version of the <RID>ASTM C1585</RID> test determines the drying 
rate of pre-saturated cementitious materials by measuring the evaporative mass loss of concrete 
slices with different thickness exposed to constant temperature and relative humidity environment.  
The moisture transport coefficient (MTC) is then determined by analyzing the mass loss data 
using the service life modeling software.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">    This test is only used for qualification of concrete mixtures, not for production concrete.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(4) Aging factor: The aging factor is a necessary value to estimate the change in diffusion 
coefficient over time.  The aging factor is defined as the ratio of the ultimate D<SBS>oh</SBS> to the 
28-day D<SBS>oh</SBS> per <RID>TR-NAVFAC ESC-CI-1215</RID>.  Since we cannot wait for two or more years to characterize 
project concrete, a surrogate aging factor is used in this specification.  This surrogate aging 
factor is calculated as the ratio of 90-day, or longer, D<SBS>oh</SBS> to the 28-day D<SBS>oh</SBS>.  The aging factor 
is determined only for qualification of concrete mixtures in compliance with <RID>TR-NAVFAC ESC-CI-1215</RID>

<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">i.  Transport Properties if using <RID>fib Bulletin 34</RID>: Determine the transport properties of the concrete 
in accordance with test procedures outlined by <RID>fib Bulletin 34</RID>.  Transport properties are required as 
inputs for service life modeling and include: the chloride migration coefficient measured as per the <RID>
NT Build 492</RID> test procedure.  The <RID>NT Build 492</RID> test is performed at 28 maturity days on a<MET> 50 mm</MET><ENG> 2 inch</ENG>
 thick sample sliced from a standard test cylinder.  The sample is immersed in a saline solution to which 
a voltage is applied to accelerate the penetration of chlorides through the concrete for a period of 
generally 24 hours.  At this time, the sample is split in half across its diameter and the depth of the 
chloride penetration is measured at seven points along the fractured surface.  This data is used to calculate 
the rate at which chlorides penetrate the concrete.  This rate is called the chloride migration coefficient 
and is a direct input value into the service life modeling.  One <RID>NT Build 492</RID> test is defined as the 
average of three specimens run together and whose results are averaged together to produce a single chloride 
migration coefficient value.  The chloride migration coefficient is determined for qualification of concrete 
mixtures and for quality acceptance testing.</LST><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Test results accomplished on concrete samples during concrete production 
that fall short of the acceptance criteria alert the Contractor to something 
in the production and placement process that has drifted out of calibration 
or that an error has been made.  The goal is to track down the problem and correct 
it as quickly as possible.  Unless the concrete producer makes a large error 
in batching or in placing, the chance that hardened concrete needs to be removed 
is remote.  Removal and replacement is a last resort.</NPR><BRK/>

life modeling simulations can be helpful to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
proposed remediation strategies.</NPR><BRK/>

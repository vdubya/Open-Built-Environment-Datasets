<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Show the following information on the project drawings:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(1)  Overall installation plan which identifies and locates tanks and equipment; 
borrow, disposal, and stockpile areas; temporary containment areas; special 
security areas; shoring and special support requirements; and access routes.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(2)  Individual as-built site plans of tank locations which identify site features 
such as buildings, roads, utilities, topography, trees and shrubs, surface condition, 
etc.  If as-built drawings are not available, a site investigation and site 
plans are required to show the general location of existing tanks and site features.  
Detail drawings to include dimensions, sections, elevations, slopes and size 
of excavations and temporary containment areas.  Provide, as part of the Tank 
Closure Report, a detailed map showing exact location of the tank prior to removal.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>(3)  Limits of pavement removal, fence removal, and the location of ancillary 
equipment to be removed.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Hardened tanks are deep buried tanks as would be found with some missile facilities.  
Note this in the contract as they require deeper excavations and possibly substantial 
demolition of concrete.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Tanks will not be abandoned in place unless a waiver is granted in accordance 
with state or local requirements<TAI OPT="AIR FORCE">, LEE HQ U.S. Air Force for Air Force Projects, 
and HQUSACE policy dated 31 July 1990, for Formerly Used Defense Sites</TAI>.  Waivers 
will be obtained prior to advertising the closure project.  Exceptions will 
be granted when requested in writing on a case by case basis.  Absence of contamination 
must still be verified prior to closure and prior to obtaining a waiver.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Incorporate installation, state and local requirements into this specification, 
including the necessary approval processes, licensing, or having their representative 
on site during removal operations.  In many cases, the state or local jurisdiction 
has final authority on approval of the Work Plan.  While states often enforce 
petroleum tank removal regulations, counties and cities are sometimes delegated authority.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Petroleum sludge and contaminated media are often considered "special wastes" 
and are subject to regulations enforced by the State Fire Marshals Office, local 
agencies, etc.  Some states have adopted federal rules for management of petroleum 
waste.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>State requirements usually involve testing, analysis, and a report.  The review 
by the state may require additional testing or other work, and may take several 
months; therefore, the designer is forewarned to investigate these requirements 
in advance.  Areas most likely to be impacted are waste and tank disposal, tank 
cleaning, residue and soil sampling and analysis, contaminated soil disposal 
or remediation, reporting, and requirements for a clean closure.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Petroleum sites which are known to have extensive soil contamination or where 
groundwater contamination is a possibility, should have a Corrective Action 
Plan under Subtitle I of RCRA and applicable state and local regulations; refer 
to EM 1110-1-4006, Removal of Underground Storage Tanks (USTs).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For sites where the tank contained a hazardous waste, remediation should occur 
under the RCRA Corrective Action requirements of 40 CFR 264, 40 CFR 265, and 
applicable state requirements.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Coordinate with the customer regarding possible designer's discussions with 
the regulators, and the existence of unique requirements.  Some MACOMS require 
the Installation Project/Program Manager to either be responsible for all coordination 
or be included on all contacts with the regulators.  For projects not on an 
active installation discuss requirements with the regulators and omit references 
to the installation and the Installation Environmental Coordinator.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Include the applicable state and local regulatory references where appropriate 
in the body of the specification.  <TAI OPT="AIR FORCE,ARMY,NAVY">It is recommended that the specifier refer 
to DoD "Policy and Guidelines for Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling 
or Testing (November 2007)</TAI></NPR><BRK/>

the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>

The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S"

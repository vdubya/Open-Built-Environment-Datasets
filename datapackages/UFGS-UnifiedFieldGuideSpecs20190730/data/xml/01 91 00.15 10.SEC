<PRT><TTL>PART 1   GENERAL</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This specification section was constructed to support Total Building 
Commissioning in accordance with UFC 1-200-02 using a commissioning specialist 
hired by the General/Prime Contractor.  <BRK/>
<BRK/>
UFC 1-200-02 requires compliance with the commissioning requirements of ASHRAE 
189.1 including the commissioning of the systems identified therein.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Specifier must edit or add content as appropriate to accommodate any additional 
systems or additional activities for Third Party Certification (TPC), if required 
for the project.  The requirements herein satisfy many of the requirements for 
LEED but may need to be augmented.  <BRK/>
<BRK/>
This specification is intended to be provided with design-bid-build construction 
specifications or with design-build request for proposal specifications.  This 
specification must be fully edited for design-build request for proposals.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For design-build projects, this specification is meant to work with other UFGS 
sections.  In the event such sections are not included in the RFP or required 
for use and as criteria by the RFP, this specification section will require 
additional editing to capture the necessary requirements of the other UFGS sections.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Very small or non-complex projects may not require commissioning to the extent 
called for in this specification section.  The commissioning requirements should 
be appropriate to the size and complexity of the building and its systems components.  
In such cases, coordinate with the Government PM to determine the appropriate 
level of commissioning and edit the specification accordingly.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Several tailoring options are included in this specification.  Select the the 
AIR FORCE or ARMY tailoring option for Air Force or Army projects. Select DESIGN-BUILD 
for design-build projects and DESIGN-BID-BUILD for design-bid-build projects.  
Select LEEDV4 tailoring option for projects pursuing LEEDv4 certification.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Select the Integrated Systems Test (IST) tailoring option when applicable.  
Integrated Systems Tests (IST) may be applicable for project with complex interactive 
operation between different systems such as fire protection, electrical distribution, 
emergency power, and HVAC.  An example is a test of HVAC and fire system operation 
with primary power down and the system switching to back-up utility or generators.  
The project team must determine whether IST will be required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If the project will include building envelope commissioning beyond the requirements 
of Specification Sections <SRF>07 27 10.00 10</SRF> BUILDING AIR BARRIER SYSTEM or 
<SRF>07 05 23</SRF> PRESSURE TESTING AN AIR BARRIER SYSTEM FOR AIR TIGHTNESS, select the 
BUILDING ENVELOPE COMMISSIONING tailoring option.  If the project will not include 
a building air barrier or additional commissioning is not required, deselect 
the BUILDING ENVELOPE COMMISSIONING tailoring option.  Coordinate with the Government 
PM, early in design or design-build contract preparation, to determine if additional 
commissioning is required or will be funded.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Some minor formatting and grammar corrections and relabeled appendices may be 
needed after making bracketed selections or applying tailoring options.</NPR><BRK/>

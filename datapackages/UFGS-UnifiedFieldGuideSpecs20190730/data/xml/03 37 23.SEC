For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S"

<NPR>This note may be disregarded for regions where Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR) 
is not a concern.  Some aggregate sources may exhibit an ASR potential.  ASR 
is a potentially deleterious reaction between alkalis present in concrete and 
some siliceous aggregates, reference EM 1110-2-2000 paragraph 2-3b(6) and appendix 
D.  Use of cementitious materials meeting the low alkali requirement may be 
effective in some applications, and insufficient in others.  In regions where 
imposing the low alkali requirement has not been effective in controlling ASR, 
additional effort for evaluation and mitigation may be required.  In which case, 
the alternate procedures to proportion cementitious materials to meet the low 
alkali requirement in paragraph 2.1.1.1 Portland Cement should not be used with 
the following requirements.  Where ASR is known or suspected to pose a concern 
for concrete durability, it is recommended that aggregates proposed for use 
in concrete be evaluated to determine ASR potential and an effective mitigation.  
EM 1110-2-2000, provides recommendations for evaluating and mitigating ASR in 
concrete mixtures.  Aggregate evaluations may not be practical for projects 
requiring small quantities of concrete (less than<MET> 200 cubic meters</MET><ENG> 250 cubic 
yards</ENG>).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> CONCRETE PAVING FOR AIRFIELDS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY PAVEMENTS, 
paragraph 2.3.1.2 Alkali-Silica Reactivity, provides a specification method 
for the Contractor to evaluate and mitigate ASR in concrete mixtures.  The expansion 
limits specified in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> are requirements for pavements and exterior 
slab construction.  For structural concrete applications the measured expansion 
shall be less than 0.10 percent.  It may not be economical or practical to specify 
different test limit requirements for use on the same project.  In which case 
the lower limit required by the application should be used.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The designer may use the specification method in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> by incorporating 
the relevant paragraphs into this specification, or may use the following requirements 
(retain either the 0.10 or the 0.08 percent expansion limits as appropriate).included

edge in a sloping and uniform fan-like manner.  RCC shall be deposited (from the conveyor, end-dump truck, or 
front-end loader) on the uncompacted RCC of the advancing edge in a forward direction from the dump pile.  RCC 
shall not be placed in consecutive or consistent lanes.  The dump location shall be varied to avoid "lane" construction.

<TXT>Whenever points on the control chart approach the upper or lower control limits, an adjustment shall be made 
in the batch weights of water and fine aggregate.  The adjustments are to be made so that the total water content 
does not exceed that amount specified in the mixture proportions provided by the Contracting Officer based on 
the free water available with the aggregates and that amount of water batched.  If the adjustments to the batch 
weights of water and aggregates do not satisfactorily produce the required slump, the Contracting Officer may 
adjust the mixture proportions if the fine-aggregate moisture content is found to be stable and within the required 
limits.  When a single slump is outside the control limits, such adjustment is mandatory.  As soon as practical 
after each adjustment, another test shall be made to verify the correctness of the adjustment.  Whenever two 
consecutive individual slump tests, made during a period when there was no adjustment of batch weights, produce 
a point on the control chart for range above the upper control limits, the slump shall be considered to be out 
of control, the concreting operation halted, and the additional testing for aggregate moisture content required 
shall be undertaken, and action taken immediately to correct the problem.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL> Air Content</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>At least one test for air content of conventional concrete shall be made on a randomly selected batch of each 
concrete mixture produced during each 8-hour period of concrete production.  Additional tests shall be made when 
excessive variation in workability is reported by the placing foreman or Government inspector.  Tests shall be 
made in accordance with <RID>ASTM C231/C231M</RID>.  The average of each test for each mixture shall be plotted on control 
charts on which the average percent and upper and lower limits are set in accordance with paragraph MIXTURE PROPORTIONS 
AND STUDIES in PART 1.  The range between two consecutive tests for each mixture shall be plotted on a control 
chart on which the upper control limits is 3.0 percent.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Air Content Corrective Action</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Whenever points on the control chart approach the upper or lower control limits, an adjustment should be made 
in the amount of air-entraining admixture batched.  If a single test result is outside the specification limit, 
immediate adjustment is mandatory.  As soon as practical after each adjustment, another test shall be made to 
verify the correction of the adjustment.  Whenever a point falls above the upper control for range, the dispenser 
shall be calibrated to ensure that it is operating correctly and with good reproducibility.  Whenever two consecutive 
points either for average or range are outside the control limits, the Contracting Officer shall be notified.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>Density shall be determined for [each<MET> 450 square meters</MET><ENG> 5,000 square feet</ENG> of completed lift] [at least eight 
locations per RCC lift] with a calibrated nuclear density gauge in accordance with <RID>ASTM C1040/C1040M</RID>.  Densities 
shall be taken at depths of<MET> 100 and 200 mm</MET><ENG> 4 and 8 inches</ENG>.  If the densities at<MET> 100 and 200 mm</MET><ENG> 4 and 8 inches</ENG>
 conflict, acceptance shall be at the<MET> 200 mm</MET><ENG> 8 inch</ENG> depth.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Action Required</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Whenever the nuclear gauge indicates density less than the specified density, a retest shall be made.  If the 
retest indicates unacceptable density, the Contracting Officer's Representative shall be notified, additional 
rolling shall be immediately provided, and a determination shall be made as to whether the lower density resulted 
from insufficient passes of the roller or a change in the mix properties.  If the mix properties have changed, 
adjustments such as increasing or decreasing the moisture content shall be made at the batch plant.  If the problem 
persists, the Contracting Officer may adjust the proportions of aggregates, cement, and/or pozzolan.  If the 
lower density is the result of incomplete rolling, the operator shall be notified and the Contracting Officer 
may require removal of the incompletely compacted material at no cost to the Government.</TXT><BRK/>

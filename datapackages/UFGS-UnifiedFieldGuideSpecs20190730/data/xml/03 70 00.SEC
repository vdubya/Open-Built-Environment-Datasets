The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<NPR>  This note may be disregarded for regions where Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR) 
is not a concern. Some aggregate sources may exhibit an ASR potential.  ASR 
is a potentially deleterious reaction between alkalis present in concrete and 
some siliceous aggregates, reference EM 1110-2-2000 paragraph 2-3b(6) and appendix 
D.  Use of cementitious materials meeting the low alkali requirement may be 
effective in some applications, and insufficient in others.  In regions where 
imposing the low alkali requirement has not been effective in controlling ASR, 
additional effort for evaluation and mitigation may be required.  In which case, 
the alternate procedures to proportion cementitious materials to meet the low 
alkali requirement in paragraph 2.1.1.1 Portland Cement should not be used with 
the following requirements.  Where ASR is known or suspected to pose a concern 
for concrete durability, it is recommended that aggregates proposed for use 
in concrete be evaluated to determine ASR potential and an effective mitigation.  
EM 1110-2-2000, provides recommendations for evaluating and mitigating ASR in 
concrete mixtures.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> CONCRETE PAVING FOR AIRFIELDS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY PAVEMENTS, 
paragraph 2.3.1.2 Alkali-Silica Reactivity, provides a specification method 
for the Contractor to evaluate and mitigate ASR in concrete mixtures.  The expansion 
limits specified in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> are requirements for pavements and exterior 
slab construction.  For structural concrete applications the measured expansion 
shall be less than 0.10 percent.  It may not be economical or practical to specify 
different test limit requirements for use on the same project.  In which case 
the lower limit required by the application should be used.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The designer may use the specification method in UFGS Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> by 
incorporating the relevant paragraphs into this specification, or may use the 
following requirements (retain either the 0.10 or the 0.08 percent expansion 
limits as appropriate) included in the set of brackets highlighted thus "[.]".</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>The grading of the fine aggregate as delivered to the mixers shall be such that the individual percent retained 
on any sieve shall not vary more than 3 percent from the percent retained on that sieve in a fixed grading selected 
by the Contractor with the approval of the Contracting Officer.  The fixed grading may be selected at the start 
of concrete placement and based upon 30 days fine aggregate production or selected after the first 30 days of 
concrete placement.  The minimum individual percent retained on the 2.36 mm (No. 8) sieve shall be 5 percent 
and on all smaller sieves[, except the 75 µm (No. 200),] shall be 10 percent.  In addition to the grading limits, 
the fine aggregate, as delivered to the mixer, shall have a fineness modulus of not less than 2.25 nor more than 
2.85.  The grading of the fine aggregate shall also be controlled so that the fineness moduli groups (average 
of the current test and the previous two tests) of the fine aggregate as delivered to the mixer shall not vary 
more than 0.10 from the target fineness modulus of the fixed grading selected by the Contractor and approved 
by the Contracting Officer.  The range of each group shall not exceed 0.20.  The fineness modulus shall be determined 
in accordance with <RID>COE CRD-C 104</RID>.  At the option of the Contractor, fine aggregate may be separated into two 
or more sizes or classifications, but the uniformity of grading of the separate sizes shall be controlled so 
that they may be combined throughout the job in fixed proportions established during the first 30 days of concrete 
placement.  The selected fixed grading shall be within the following limits, except any individual test result 
may be outside these limits if within the allowable 3 percent variation from the selected grading.</TXT><BRK/>

match colors.  Dry-packed mortar shall consist of one part cement to two and one-half parts fine aggregate.  
The fine aggregate shall be that used for production of project concrete.  The mortar shall be remixed over a 
period of at least 30 minutes without addition of water until it obtains the stiffest consistency that will permit 
placing.  Mortar shall be thoroughly compacted into the prepared void by tamping, rodding, ramming, etc. and 
struck off to match adjacent concrete.  Replacement concrete shall be produced using project materials and shall 
be proportioned by the Contracting Officer.  It shall be thoroughly compacted into the prepared void by internal 
vibration, tamping, rodding, ramming, etc. and shall be struck off and finished to match adjacent concrete.  
Forms shall be used to confine the concrete.  If an expanding agent is used in the repair concrete, the repair 
shall be thoroughly confined on all sides including the top surface.  Metal tools shall not be used to finish 
permanently exposed surfaces.  The repaired areas shall be cured for 7 days.  The temperature of the in situ 
concrete, adjacent air, and replacement mortar or concrete shall be above<MET> 5 degrees C</MET><ENG> 40 degrees F</ENG> during placement, 
finishing, and curing.  Packaged materials meeting the requirements of <RID>ASTM C928/C928M</RID> may be used in lieu of

cement as used on the project, to two parts by volume of well-graded sand passing a 600-µm (No. 30) sieve mixed 
with water to the consistency of thick paint.  White cement shall be used for all or part of the cement as approved 
to give the desired finish color.  The applied coating shall be uniform, completely filling all pits, air bubbles,

float, burlap pad, or other means.  Then, after the surface whitens from drying (about 30 minutes at normal temperature),

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  These paragraphs should be edited based on whether the contract will 
use lump sum, or unit prices.  If there is a separate Measurement and Payment 
Section, edited versions of these paragraphs should be inserted in that section.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the quantities of contaminated soils are well defined, payment may be based 
upon a lump sum structure.  However, it is usually more cost-effective to use 
a unit price structure when there is a significant degree of uncertainty in 
the amount of contaminated material.  When specifying a unit price structure 
for treatment, separate items should be provided in the Contract Price Schedule 
to cover any other work required.  Other work items include, but are not limited 
to: preparation of submittals, mobilization and demobilization, site preparation, 
construction of the treatment cell and run on/runoff controls, water storage 
facilities, contact water treatment and disposal, sampling and testing, implementing 
health and safety requirements, and utilities.  Inclusion of separate items 
in the Contract Price Schedule for the above work tasks should result in a lower 
unit price for treatment.</NPR><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Bench-Scale Testing</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Lump sum pricing is recommended for this item.  The lump sum should include 
the cost for testing for chemical data.  However, bidders should also be required 
to provide a unit cost amount for testing for chemical data.  This will provide 
a basis for payment for additional analytical costs, if it is determined that 
more testing will be required.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Payment for bench-scale testing will be a lump sum price for completion of specified tests.  The price must include 
the cost of labor, materials, equipment usage, utilities, and fuel for: [preparation of the Bench-Scale Test 
Plan] [collecting samples,] [sample shipment,] [pre-processing,] [process monitoring (including testing for chemical 
data),] [disposal of treated material,] [ancillary waste treatment and disposal,] [preparation of the Bench-Scale

<SPT><TTL>Field Demonstration</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Prior to planning the field demonstration, bench-scale testing should 
be performed to determine if the contaminants of concern are amenable to landfarming 
in the site-specific soil matrix.  The field demonstration may either be conducted 
prior to the construction of the full-scale facilities, or conducted using the 
full-scale facilities and equipment.  Payment for the field demonstration should 
be covered by a separate lump sum item, or by a unit price that is separate 
from the unit price for full-scale treatment.  Because more intensive monitoring 
is usually required during the field demonstration, the unit price for the field 
demonstration will usually be higher than the unit price for full-scale treatment.  
Testing for chemical data is not included as a component of the price in this 
paragraph.  The contract price schedule should include separate, unit price 
items for testing for chemical data.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the results of the field demonstration indicate that an extended treatment 
period (or other special measures) will be required to meet cleanup goals, it 
may become necessary to modify the bid item that covers treatment pricing for 
full-scale operations.</NPR><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Testing for chemical data is not included in the unit price.  The contract 
price schedule should include separate, unit price items for testing for chemical 
data.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Unit price payment may either be based on weight or volume (in-place or ex-situ).  
This paragraph uses ex-situ volume as the default unit.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If unit price payment will be based on weight, dry weight should be specified 
and requirements should be included for moisture content testing so that dry 
weight can be determined.  However, surveys are usually required before and 
after excavation of contaminated material, so that excavation and backfilling 
can be paid for on the basis of in-place volume.  Thus, in some cases, it may 
be advantageous to pay for processing and treatment of soils using in-place 
volume as the pricing unit.  Payment may also be based on ex-situ volume, after 
the oversize materials have been separated from the soil.  Because of the bulking 
which usually occurs during excavation of soil, ex-situ volume will usually 
be about 30 percent greater than the in-situ volume.  If there is a substantial 
volume of oversize material, or if a substantial volume of excavated material 
will not require treatment, it may be advantageous to use ex-situ volume as 
the basis for payment.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This paragraph should be coordinated with the treatment criteria and sampling 
requirements paragraphs so that it will be possible to distinguish between soil 
that passes, and does not pass, treatment criteria.</NPR><BRK/>

[pre-processing,] [operation, maintenance and process monitoring (not including testing for chemical data),] 
[disposal of treated material,] [ancillary waste treatment and disposal,] [preparation of operations reports,] 
[and] [_____].  Costs for procurement and handling of amendments must be included in the unit price for treatment.  
After each lift of soil has been treated, the quantity of soil that does not meet treatment criteria must be 
reported and subtracted from the quantity of soil comprising the lift, when determining payment for treatment.  
See paragraph Treatment Cell Sizing below, for a definition of "lift of soil".  Payment will not be made for 
soil that does not meet treatment criteria.  If additional tests, or additional processing and testing, are necessary 
to show that material meets treatment criteria, the additional costs must be borne by the Contractor.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Landfarming Treatment Cell</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Siting of the treatment facility should be in accordance with regulatory 
requirements.  The prevailing wind direction and the potential for dust generation 
should also be taken into consideration.  The design of the treatment cell should 
include provisions for control of storm water and contact water, and should 
take into account the expected wheel loads of material handling equipment.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>In-situ applications of landfarming are usually not recommended due to the potential 
for spreading contamination into the vadose zone and groundwater.  Typically, 
treatment of contaminated soil is performed in a lined treatment cell.  Lined 
treatment cells usually include a composite clay or geomembrane liner with a 
leachate collection system.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Care should be used when applying standards established for landfill liner systems, 
to avoid requiring over-conservative and costly designs.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The treatment cell must be located in an area where seasonal, high water table level is at least<MET> [1.5] [_____] 
meters</MET><ENG> [5.0] [_____] feet</ENG> below the lowest level of the liner.  The treatment cell must be designed to support 
the load of material handling and tilling equipment.  The water collection system and sump must be in accordance 
with paragraph Contact Water Management System and Design Storm, below.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Treatment Cell Sizing</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The dimensions of the treatment cell should be based on the amount of 
time required to reach cleanup goals for each lift of soil (including laboratory 
turn-around time for compliance testing), the volume of soil and amendments 
that can be held in the treatment cell, the configuration of the irrigation 
system, and the type of material handling equipment that will be used.  A pie-shaped, 
or semi-circular, treatment cell lends itself well to the use of a center-pivot 
irrigation system.  Laboratory turn-around time is usually about 2 to 4 weeks.  
The depth to which soil can be treated (i.e., lift depth) is limited by the 
practical depth of tilling (usually about<MET> 300 mm</MET><ENG> 1 foot</ENG>).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Traditionally, new lifts of contaminated soil were placed in the treatment cell 
after treatment of preceding lifts were completed.  However, material handling 
requirements may be decreased by placing the entire volume of contaminated soil 
onto the treatment cell at once.  Under the latter scenario, treated lifts are 
successively removed after they have been shown to meet clean-up goals.  One-time 
placement of all the contaminated soil onto the treatment cell may also eliminate 
the need to establish a contaminated soil stockpile area.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The treatment cell must be located [within the area indicated on the drawings] [_____].  The treatment cell must 
be sized to hold at least [_____]<MET> cubic meters</MET><ENG> cubic yards</ENG> of soil per lift, based on a lift depth of<MET> [0.3] [_____] 
meters</MET><ENG> [1] [_____] foot</ENG>.  A lift is a single layer of contaminated soil contained within the treatment cell.  
Active treatment occurs primarily in the uppermost lift of soil in the treatment cell.  Traditionally, a new 
lift of contaminated soil is placed in the treatment cell after treatment of the preceding lift has been completed.  
Alternatively, the entire volume of contaminated soil may be placed onto the treatment cell at once; then treated 
lifts are successively removed after they have been shown to meet clean-up goals.  Sizing of the treatment cell 
must be based on completing treatment of the estimated, total volume of contaminated soil in [_____] months from 
initiating treatment of the first lift, assuming treatment is initiated on the following date: [_____].</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Porous Drainage Layer</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The gradation limits of the porous drainage layer should be compatible 
with the grain-size distribution of the contaminated soil.  Gradation limits 
should be determined as shown in EM 1110-2-1913, Engineering and Design - Design 
of Construction Levees (see Appendix D Filter Design).  The slot width of the 
leachate drainage piping (or pore size of filter fabric around the drainage 
piping) must also be compatible with the gradation limits of the porous drainage layer.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Geotextiles may be incorporated into the porous drainage layer to help prevent 
fines from migrating into the leachate collection system.  Due to the potential 
for clogging, use of geotextiles could pose a problem for a treatment cell that 
is designed for long-term operation.  Geotextiles provide attachment sites for 
microorganisms.  Growth of biomass may lead to reductions in the permeability 
of the geotextile material.  However, experience at Region 8 EPA landfarming 
operations for treatment of creosote-contaminated soil indicates that clogging 
of geotextile has not been observed at projects that were completed within about 
5 years.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
To protect the drainage piping, a minimum distance should be maintained between 
the top of the drainage piping and the top of the porous drainage layer (e.g.<MET>
, 203 to 254 mm</MET><ENG> 8 to 10 inches</ENG>).  Use of low-profile piping, such as panel pipe 
for highway edge drains, laid flat against the geomembrane will allow the thickness 
of the porous drainage layer to be minimized.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The porous drainage layer must be designed to facilitate drainage of free water and to prevent entry of contaminated 
soils.  The porous drainage layer must be at least<MET> [0.3] [_____] meters</MET><ENG> [1.0] [_____] feet</ENG> thick.  The gradation 
limits of the porous drainage layer must be compatible with the grain size distribution of representative samples 
of contaminated soil, and must be selected in accordance with Appendix D of <RID>EM 1110-2-1913</RID>.  The minimum compacted 
hydraulic conductivity of the porous drainage layer must be<MET> [1 x (10 to the minus 2 power)] [_____] cm/s</MET><ENG> [3.28 
x (10 to the minus 4 power)] [_____] feet/s</ENG>.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Leachate Controls and Collection</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Lined landfarm units should have a granular drainage layer to allow free 
water to drain from the soil layer, and a leachate collection system to remove 
drainage.  Some problems unique to landfarming applications are:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a.  Exposure to equipment traffic (e.g., applying soil, tilling, and removing 
soil), can damage drainage layers and liners.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>b.  Removing lifts of treated soil requires scraping and shoveling the treated 
lift from the treatment cell, typically with a front-end loader.  To protect 
the leachate collection and geomembrane layers, an armoring layer (gravel or 
crushed stone) is often used to indicate over-excavation to the equipment operator.  
The armoring layer is usually positioned immediately above the porous drainage 
layer.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Slotted piping generally has more area available for water to flow into the 
pipe than perforated piping, and is less susceptible to clogging and fouling 
than filter fabric covered piping.  Thus slotted piping should be considered 
for treatment cells that are designed for long-term operation, or where clogging 
or fouling is a strong concern.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Perforated piping is generally less expensive than slotted.  The combination 
of perforated piping within a geotextile (filter fabric) sleeve has been used 
with success in landfarm drainage layers.  The pore size of the geotextile must 
be compatible with the grain-size distribution of the porous drainage layer.  
Installing a layer of geotextile across the entire area of a treatment cell 
is not recommended because it would require substantially more material than 
using only geotextile sleeves around the collection piping, and geotextile sheets 
would be susceptible to damage during removal of lifts of treated soil.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Leachate drainage lines are routed to a sump, which is usually placed below 
the treatment cell.  The sump usually consist of a lined depression in the impermeable 
layer packed with gravel.  Water holding facilities outside of the treatment 
cell are commonly used for additional water storage capacity.  When the gravel 
sump reaches a set level, water is pumped from the sump to the outer water holding 
facility.  Options for water storage facilities outside of the treatment cell 
include: an above-ground storage tank, a reinforced concrete basin, vertical 
caisson piping, or a lined earthen pit.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Slots in drainage collection piping must be appropriately sized for the porous drainage layer in accordance with 
Appendix D of <RID>EM 1110-2-1913</RID>.  Drainage water must be routed to a lined, gravel sump [as shown on the drawings].</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Geomembrane and Clay Liners</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Liners usually consist of HDPE geomembrane or recompacted clay.  It is 
atypical to require a composite liner system for a temporary landfarming facility.  
Options have been provided for HDPE liners and recompacted clay liners.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If granular material in the drainage layer is greater than<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG>, a 
sand or geotextile protective layer should be required between the geomembrane 
liner and the granular material.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The drawings should provide requirements for sloping of the surface of the liner.  
Recommended, minimum sloping requirements are as follows:  2 percent from the 
sides of the treatment cell to the central drainage line, and 1 percent over 
the length of the central drainage line (from the upslope end to the entry into 
the gravel sump).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Sections <SRF>02 56 13</SRF> WASTE CONTAINMENT GEOMEMBRANE and <SRF>02 56 14</SRF> CLAY BARRIER LAYER 
provide some testing requirements for the liner.  Additional testing and leak 
monitoring may be necessary for some projects.  Leak monitoring will be more 
important for projects where the treatment cell is located over an area with 
clean groundwater and a clean vadose zone.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Monitoring wells, downgradient of the treatment cell, can be used to determine 
if leaks have occurred in the past.  Lysimeters may be installed within and 
around the perimeter of the treatment cell.  If used, lysimeters should be installed 
before the liner to avoid damage to the liner during placement of lysimeters.  
Penetrations through the liner must also be properly sealed.  Lysimeters may 
Generally there is greater potential for leaks to occur in the sump, than in 
other locations of the liner.  Water may remain in the sump for extended periods 
if the sump is being used to store contact water.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Leak sensing technologies are described in the following reference, Leak Detection 
for Landfill Liners, Overview of Tools for Vadose Zone Monitoring, Karen Hix, 
Technology Status Report Prepared for USEPA Technology Innovation Office under 
a National Network of Environmental Management Studies Fellowship, Aug. 1998.  
The reference can be accessed at the following internet site:  http://www.clu-in.org/download/char/leaklnfl.pdf<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Most of the leak sensing technologies involve installation of leak sensing devices 
below the liner, prior to placement of the liner.  Because of the relatively 
high capitol and O&amp;M costs for leak detection systems, they are usually 
not installed.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
As a relatively inexpensive construction QA measure, the Two Electrode method 
can be used for leak testing of the sump area.  The test can be performed by 
filling the sump with water (before it has been filled with gravel) for a set 
period (e.g., 24 hours), and monitoring for passage of current from the inside 
the sump to the soil outside of the sump area.  If currrent is detected in the 
electrode placed in the soil outside of the sump area, then the liner is checked 
for penetrations, repaired, and the test is repeated.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Leak testing, using one of the methods or devices described in the above reference, 
is highly recommended; especially in the area immediately below the sump.</NPR><BRK/>

It is recommended that the surface of the treatment cell be sloped so that surface 
run-off from high intensity precipitation events and snow melt can be collected

<TXT>Contact water is defined as water that has come into contact with contaminated materials, or other contaminated 
surfaces.  Sources of contact water may include, but are not limited to:  water from decontamination of equipment, 
personnel, and PPE; runoff water from storage and pre-processing areas; and water that leaches through the treatment

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Typically, storage and testing of contact water is required prior to 
discharge.  Thus contact water storage facilities should be sized to contain 
the peak detention volume for the design storm.  In order to minimize treatment 
and disposal costs, it is often desirable to reuse the contact water to irrigate 
the treatment cell.  Using this approach, the storage volume must be sufficient 
to retain the volume of water in storage prior to the design storm, and the 
volume of water generated by the design storm.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Sources of contact water include:  water from decontamination of equipment, 
personnel, and PPE; and water that drains from storage, pre-processing and treatment 
areas.  If the storage, pre-processing, or treatment areas are covered, then 
the volume of contact water resulting from precipitation events should be reduced.</NPR><BRK/>

water can usually be applied to contaminated soil with little or no treatment.  
Water which has accumulated excessive levels of acids, bases or salts may require 
treatment, or offsite disposal.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Irrigation is critical to maintaining optimum moisture content, and maintaining 
high degradation rates.  In arid climates, water usage rates will obviously 
be higher than in non-arid climates.  Drip irrigation systems are generally 
not recommended for landfarming because they are not designed to distribute 
moisture uniformly.  Center-pivot irrigation systems have been successfully 
used in conjunction with pie-shaped, or semi-circular, treatment cells.</NPR><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This paragraph should be deleted if there will be no requirement for 
use of a weather cover.  Weather covers allow an added measure of control over 
moisture delivery to the treatment cell, and may also be used to increase soil 
temperature.  Use of a weather cover will also allow the scale of the contact 
water management facilities to be reduced.  Clam-shell buildings, metal buildings, 
pole barns, large tents, or other prefabricated structures may serve as weather 
covers.  The section containing requirements for the weather cover (e.g., Section 
<SRF>13 34 19</SRF> PREENGINEERED METAL BUILDINGS), should include the design snow load, 
maximum wind speed, soil bearing capacity, seismic parameters in accordance 
with UFC 3-310-04, maximum and minimum ambient air temperatures.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If landfarming will be performed inside of an enclosed structure, adequate ventilation 
must be provided.  A rate of 3 to 6 air changes per hour has been recommended 
for composting facilities.  Carbon dioxide is generated and oxygen may become 
depleted during landfarming.  However, rates of oxygen consumption for most 
landfarming applications will be significantly lower than that of composting.  
During material handling operations (e.g., tilling) dust and engine exhaust 
fumes will accumulate.  To ensure that proper and consistent ventilation requirements 
are specified, this section should be coordinated with Section <SRF>23 00 00</SRF> AIR

<NPR>NOTE:  Landfarming is primarily applicable to nonvolatile and semi-volatile 
organic contaminants, including: low-volatility components of fuels, diesel 
fuel, kerosine-based fuels, fuel oils, pentachlorophenol (PCP), some polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, as found in creosote), some pesticides, and some 
herbicides.  Biodegradation of PAHs becomes more difficult as the number of 
rings increases.  Thus, landfarming is usually not considered to be an efficient 
process for treating PAHs that contain more than four aromatic rings.  Contaminated 
soil will be aerated during tilling and material handling operations.  Thus, 
the volatility of contaminants of concern should be taken into consideration 
to ensure that air emissions requirements are not exceeded.  Non-weathered, 
light fuels such as gasoline are not suitable for landfarming since the most 
toxic components (i.e., BTEX) will readily volatilize.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Depending on regulatory requirements, both total concentration and leachability 
concentrations for some compounds may be required.  Total concentrations can 
be used to estimate worst case leachate concentrations.  If the contaminated 
material is classified as characteristic waste, leachability testing will usually 
be required, and the appropriate leachability test (e.g., EPA Synthetic Precipitation 
Leachate Procedure (SPLP) or EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure 
(TCLP)) must be selected.  If the treated material will not be disposed of in 
a landfill, SPLP testing may be appropriate.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Although there are EPA Land Application regulations for metals and pathogens 
(40 CFR 503 - Standards for Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge), these regulations 
are not normally applicable to hazardous waste landfarming.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>For compounds whose partial breakdown products (intermediates) have been defined, 
it may be necessary to include testing for key intermediates.  However, it may 
not be practical to require testing for intermediates if chemical standards 
are not available.  A compound should not be targeted for analysis unless there 
is a defensible basis for acquiring the data (e.g., if there is strong probability 
of generating an intermediate with higher toxicity than the parent compound).<BRK/>
<BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  For some projects this paragraph could be combined with the above paragraph, 
Treatment Criteria for Soil.  For the purposes of this guide specification, 
this paragraph has been separated to emphasize that a separate set of regulatory 
criteria may have to be met before treated soil can be incorporated into top soil.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The land application or beneficial use of treated soil will be largely controlled 
by existing land disposal restrictions (40 CFR 268), specifically toxicity characteristics 
for RCRA metals, volatiles, and semi-volatiles and any triggered universal treatment 
standards (40 CFR 268.48).  While the metals loading rates found in 40 CFR 503 
(i.e., 40 CFR 503.13 - Pollutant limits) may be useful in evaluating beneficial 
reuse alternatives, the designer is cautioned that the scope of this standard 
is for domestic sewage sludge.  Soils treated via landfarming may not meet this 
definition, and therefore would not be excluded from hazardous waste management 
regulations.  The application of ceiling values listed in 40 CFR 503.13 to treated 
soil not excluded from hazardous waste regulations, is not allowed under regulation 
(40 CFR 503.6).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Although reductions in concentrations of heavy metals may occur due to mixing 
and dilution effects, landfarming is usually not considered a treatment process 
for inorganics.  Depending on regulatory requirements and intended end use, 
it may be necessary to require testing for some inorganic parameters.  The treatment 
criteria shown below are only examples.  This paragraph should be edited to 
include site-specific criteria.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Oversized materials are typically separated from contaminated soil during 
soil pre-processing.  Relatively impermeable oversize materials (e.g., rocks) 
are often treated by rinsing or pressure washing.  However, clods of contaminated 
soil or other large particle-size materials that are not broken-up during tilling 
cannot be assumed to be adequately treated by landfarming.  If attrition of 
this chunk-material does not occur with repeated tilling, it may be necessary 
to perform additional sampling and analysis specifically to determine if chunk-material 
is being treated.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Particle size criteria may be waived if sampling and analysis of the large particle-size 
materials demonstrates that treatment criteria is being achieved.  A sufficient 
quantity of large particle-size material should be collected so that samples 
will be representative of the "chunk-fraction" throughout the treatment cell.  
The large particle-size material must then be ground-up so that subsamples can 
be submitted for testing.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If treatment of large particle-size materials can not be adequately demonstrated, 
then an additional processing step may be necessary.  Equipment such as soil 
shredders will increase the cost of treatment, but can be used to reduce the 
particle size and thereby improve the degree of treatment achieved.  The goal

For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S"

<SPT><TTL>AMENDMENTS</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Use of amendments may not be necessary for treatment of some types of 
soils.  Adding amendments such as manure at too high of a rate can change porosity 
characteristics, and may prevent proper drainage and aeration.  Organic contaminants 
will adsorb onto organic amendments (e.g., wood chips), and may become less 
available to degrading microorganisms.  Adsorption of contaminants can make 
it appear like the contaminants have been biodegraded.  An in-depth discussion 
of adsorption and bio-transformation reactions can be found in the chapter titled, 
"Microbe-Soil-Organic Contaminant Interactions", Haider, K., from the text, 
Bioremediation of Contaminated Soils, Agronomy Monograph no. 37, American Society 
of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society of America, 1999.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Factors driving selection of amendments include:  seasonal availability, proximity 
of sources to the site, costs, storage and handling properties, moisture content, 
odor potential, texture and porosity, carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio, previous 
experience with using an amendment, and consistency in the quality of an amendment.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Addition of manure is an inexpensive way to bolster microbial activity, provide 
nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and micro-nutrients), and increase the field 
capacity of sandy soils.  Relative to most other types of manure, chicken manure 
has a high nitrogen content.  Fresh manure will contain higher levels of nitrogen 
than dried.  Nutrients will leach more readily from fresh than from dried manure.  
Swine manure is not recommended due to the potential for odor problems.  Because 
of the diversity of the bacterial populations within their digestive systems, 
manure from ruminant animals (e.g., cows) is generally considered to be good 
source of microbial innoculum.  Bedding materials will often be intermixed with 
manure.  These bedding materials may help increase porosity, depending on the 
soil type.  Pope and Matthews previously recommended that manure  be applied 
to each lift at a rate of about 3-4 percent by weight of soil (Bioremediation 
Using the Land Treatment Concept, EPA/600/R-93/164).  Pope currently recommends 
a 2-4 application rate.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Arsenic-containing compounds are often fed to chicken, turkey and swine as growth 
promoters.  Thus, there is potential for residual levels of As to be present 
in these types of manure (see "Sources and Practices Contributing to Soil Contamination", 
Knox, A. S., et al., from the text, Bioremediation of Contaminated Soils, Agronomy 
Monograph no. 37, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, 
Soil Science Society of America, 1999.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The C and N contents of candidate amendments can be estimated using literature 
values, see Appendix A of the On-Farm Composting Handbook (Northeast Regional 
Agricultural Engineering Service, 1992).  Laboratory testing, for moisture and 
ash content, may also be used to estimate carbon content.  By subtracting the 
ash content from the dry weight, the organic matter content can be determined.  
The carbon content is usually estimated by dividing the organic matter content 
by 1.8.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Carbon in the form of aged wood, or other aged wood products is generally considered 
to be unavailable.  Carbon in manure and other relatively soluble organic materials 
is generally considered to be available.  Amendments with high C:N ratios, and 
high levels of available carbon, will tend to exert a nitrogen demand.  Microorganisms 
will consume nitrogen as they degrade the organic carbon in the amendment.  
Use of amendments high in available carbon and with high C:N ratios should be 
limited; as their use will increase the amount of fertilizer needed to replenish 
nitrogen.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Wood chips, shredded wood or bark may be used to increase the porosity of soil; 
however, depending on plans for end-use, large-diameter materials may have to 
be separated from treated soil.  It becomes more difficult to maintain aerobic 
conditions as the porosity decreases, and as the moisture content increases 
(see paragraph Moisture Control, in PART 3).  Organic contaminants will often 
adsorb and accumulate onto wood products present in the contaminated-soil matrix.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Wood products derived from treated wood should not be used, as this may result 
in secondary contamination of soil.  Treated wood may contain CCA (chromated 
copper arsenate), PAHs (from creosote), pentachlorophenol, or other contaminants.  
Types of wood which contain naturally occurring compounds that inhibit microbial 
activity (e.g., cedar) should be avoided.  Freshly processed wood products can 
also release other organic compounds (e.g., organic acids) that can be detrimental 
to the treatment process.  Wood products should be aged under moist conditions 
for several months prior to use.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  If a proven type of amendment will be used, testing may not be necessary.  
However, if a type of amendment has been proposed for which there is no previous 
experience, the following tests should be considered:  bulk density, moisture 
content, field capacity (or water holding capacity), conductivity, pH, organic 
matter content (or volatile solids), ash content, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen 
(TKN).  The field capacity of coarse, sandy soils may be improved by adding 
an amendment with a high field capacity.  Conductivity is an indicator of salt 
content.  High salt levels can be detrimental to microbial activity.  Organic 
matter content, ash content, and TKN can be used to determine C:N ratios (see 
note under paragraph Amendments, in PART 2).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Contaminants may be present in an amendment that could affect plans for disposal

The field demonstration requirements are a function of the uncertainty of the 
materials to be treated.  For well defined wastes, known to be amenable to landfarming, 
optimization testing may be adequate.  Optimization testing would typically 
be performed using full-scale equipment and facilities.  If the amenability 
of the contaminated material to landfarming, has not been established, the field 
demonstration should be preceded by bench-scale testing.  If the process has

Operation, Maintenance and Process Monitoring requirements may need to be prepared.  
The following differences in monitoring requirements are typical for the field 
demonstration versus full-scale operations:  sampling stations may be spaced 
more densely; temperature, moisture, and respiration testing may be performed 
more frequently; and sampling and analysis for contaminants of concern may be 
performed on a more frequent, and more regular basis.  A sufficient number of 
samples should be tested to assess the heterogeneity of contaminant concentrations.  
The field demonstration may also provide an opportunity to develop a site-specific 
correlation between field, and laboratory analysis methods.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
A sufficient amount of time should be scheduled for the field demonstration 
to determine the amount of time it will take to reach cleanup goals during full-scale 
operations.  Degradation rates typically decrease as contaminant levels decrease; 
e.g., it may take 3 times as long to go from 25 to 10 mg/kg as it takes to from 
100 to 25 mg/kg.  Thus, trends in contaminant levels should not be extrapolated 
in an attempt to predict how long it will take to reach cleanup goals.</NPR><BRK/>

the formation of hard clods; especially, for soils with high clay content.  
Light irrigation prior to tilling will help keep dust down.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The direction of tilling should be alternated to facilitate thorough mixing 
and uniform treatment of the contaminated material.  Thorough tilling will result 
in more homogenous soil, and should reduce the variability of chemical data.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The goal of tilling is to mix and aerate the soil while minimizing compaction.  
Tilling too frequently can compromise soil structure (i.e., reduce pore volume, 
and lead to compaction).  Although conventional agricultural plowing methods 
(e.g., using a disk harrow or chisel plows) can result in some degree of mixing 
and aeration, they are usually much less effective than rotary tilling equipment.  
Periodic deep tilling (to a depth of about<MET> 500 mm</MET><ENG>1.6 ft</ENG>) using subsoil tillers 
can be used to provide a limited degree aeration at depth, and may hasten treatment 
of soil below the depth limit of a rotary tiller.<BRK/>

Although most categories of organic contaminants biodegrade most readily under 
aerobic conditions, there are some types of contaminants that are more amenable 
to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.  There are also some contaminants 
that are most readily biodegraded under alternating conditions (e.g., anaerobic

of field capacity (or water holding capacity) provides a more universal indicator 
of the degree of saturation.  Field capacity is determined by saturating a sample, 
allowing the free water to drain, and then determining the moisture content; 
field capacity is the mass of water in the sample divided by the dry weight.  
According to Bioremediation Using the Land Treatment Concept, EPA/600/R-93/164, 
field capacity can range from 5 percent (for a sandy soil) to 30 percent (for 
a clay soil).  The recommended moisture content for landfarming is between 40

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Commercial fertilizers are often used as a source of nitrogen (N) for 
landfarming operations. In commercial fertilizer specifications, N is the first 
of the three components listed (i.e., 33:3:3 refers to N:P:K).  The N and P 
(phosphorous) content is usually expressed as weight percent of N and phosphorus 
pentoxide equivalents (P2O5) in the fertilizer.  To determine the percent of 
P, by weight, the number corresponding to P should be divided by 2.3.  The potassium 
content, expressed as K2O, in commercial fertilizers is much more significant 
for plants than it is for microbial nutrition.  Slow release fertilizers require 
less frequent application and supply nutrients at a more constant level.  Examples 
of slow-release, nitrogen fertilizers include: sulfur-coated urea, urea formaldehyde, 
as well as some organic products (e.g., fish meal, blood meal, etc.).  Agricultural 
spreaders are commonly used to distribute fertilizer across the treatment cell, 
or it may be dissolved into irrigation water and applied to the cell by the 
irrigation system.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
When measuring nutrients in soils it is important to distinguish between available 
and total concentrations of N and P.  Readily available nutrients are in a form 
that can be rapidly assimilated by microorganisms.  Total nitrogen is usually 
determined by adding the level of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) to that of nitrate 
nitrogen.  TKN includes ammonia nitrogen and nitrogen bound to organics.  Nitrate 
and ammonia (inorganic N) represent the most readily available forms of nitrogen.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
There are several different methods for determining available phosphorous in 
soil.  Agricultural labs often use the Bray P-1 method (also known as Phosphorous 
Soluble in Dilute Acid-Fluoride).  For highly calcareous soils (greater than 
4 percent calcium carbonate), the Olsen P method (also known as Phosphorous 
Soluble in Sodium Bicarbonate) is recommended.  For additional information on 
test methods see, Methods of Soil Analysis, Part 2 Chemical and Microbiological 
Properties, American Society of Agronomy and Soil Science Society of America, 1982.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
A wide range of optimal carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) and carbon to phosphorous (C:P) 
ratios for landfarming have been reported in the literature.  A C:N:P ratio 
range of 100:10:1 to 300:10:1 was recommended (Pope &amp; Matthews, EPA/600/R-93/164).  
C:N ratios between 25:1 and 38:1 have also been recommended (Huddleston, R.L., 
et al., Land treatment biological degradation processes.  p. 41-61. In R.C. 
Lowhr and J.F. Malina, Jr. (editors) Land treatment: A hazardous waste management 
alternative. Water Resour. Symposium 13th. Center for Research in Water Resour., 
Univ. of Texas, Austin, 1986.)<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Insufficient nitrogen levels may lead to sub-optimal degradation rates.  However, 
excessive levels of nitrate and ammonia can also reduce hydrocarbon degradation 
rates (see Huesemann, "Guidelines for Land-Treating Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Contaminated 
Soils", Journal of Soil Contamination, 3(3):299-318, 1994).  Also organic nitrogen 
is often present in soil before fertilizer has been added, and recycling of 
nitrogen will occur as microorganisms die-off.  According to Huesmann, one-time 
additions of inorganic N should be limited, and inorganic N levels should be 
maintained above a threshold level of about 50 mg/kg.  Treatment of soil with 
high levels of organic contaminants usually requires repeated applications of N.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If the Contractor can demonstrate that increasing one-time applications of N 
to a value higher than that prescribed below does not adversely affect contaminant 
degradation rates, then the Contractor should present such data to obtain approval 
to increase one-time N application rates.  However the data should be from the 
same site, using the same soil type, the same type of N amendment, and treating 
the same contaminants.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  The optimum pH range for biodegradation of most types of contaminants 
is between 6.0 and 8.5 standard units.  However, where acclimated populations 
of microbes are present, degradation may proceed at an adequate rate when the 
pH is as low as 5.0.  The pH can influence the availability of N, P, micronutrients, 
metals and some types of organic contaminants (see Sims, et al., Prepared Bed 
Bioreactors, in Bioremediation of Contaminated Soils, Agronomy Monograph no. 
37, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science

<BRK/>
Biological degradation of organic constituents may result in a reduction of 
the pH of soils.  Strong caustics should not be used to adjust the pH of the 
soil because they can cause large, rapid changes in soil pH, which may inhibit 
biological activity.  Crushed limestone or lime are commonly used to increase 
the pH.  Agricultural lime is available in several particle-size grades.  Finely 
graded material acts faster than coarsely graded product.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Some soils are naturally alkaline and may require downward pH adjustment.  Sulfur-based 
amendments (e.g., elemental sulfur) may be used to decrease the pH of the soil.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The goal of pH adjustment should be to adjust the pH in small increments.  If 
it appears that pH adjustment may be necessary, samples should be sent to a 
local soils laboratory (after ascertaining that the laboratory can accept soil 
from a hazardous waste site).  Agricultural extension services (e.g., USDA, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service) possess knowledge of local soil characteristics<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Depleted oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide levels in soil gas are often 
used as indicators of microbial respiration.  Soil gas testing may be performed 
in the field, and can provide a real-time indicator of microbial activity.  
However, respiration tests do not target the specific groups of microorganisms 
responsible for degrading contaminants of concern.  Oxygen is usually considered 
to be a better indicator than carbon dioxide because carbon dioxide can be released 
(or consumed) via abiotic reactions.  Levels of respiration are dependent on 
temperature and moisture.  Thus, respiration measurements should be accompanied 
by temperature and moisture measurements.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Oxygen levels will usually decrease gradually after each tilling event as aerobic 
microorganisms consume oxygen.  Oxygen concentrations greater than about 2 percent, 
by volume, are generally indicative of aerobic conditions.  The concentration 
of oxygen in the atmosphere is approximately 21 percent, by volume.  For most 
types of organic contaminants, rates of biodegradation will be highest under 
aerobic conditions.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The depth of insertion of the gas probe and the volume of sample withdrawn must 
be synchronized to minimize the chances of drawing in air from the atmosphere.

<NPR>NOTE:  Definitive field analysis methods (e.g., immunoassay or colorimetric 
test kits) are usually much less expensive than laboratory analysis for contaminants 
of concern.  However, a site-specific correlation between data from field and 
laboratory analysis should be developed.  Pigmented materials present in extracts 
from soil samples may cause interferences in colorimetric, definitive field 
analysis.  Laboratory analysis should be required on a minimum percentage of 
samples to verify data from definitive field analysis.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The goal of the sampling should be to collect samples that are chemically and 
physically representative of the soil in the treatment cell.  The strategy for 
sampling and analysis should be consistent with the regulatory requirements 
for the data.  See the following reference for more information on sample collection 
procedures and analytical protocols:  EM 200-1-3, Requirements for the Preparation 
of Sampling and Analysis Plans.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Sample designs that may be applied to treatment cells include: simple random, 
ranked set, and systematic grid.  Systematic grid sampling is simple to apply, 
and provides for relatively uniform coverage of the area of interest (i.e., 
the treatment cell).  See the following reference for more information on sampling 
designs: Guidance on Choosing a Sampling Design for Environmental Data Collection 
(G-5S), EPA/240/R-02/005, Dec. 2002.  Visual Sampling Plan, a useful software 
program that can be used to develop sampling designs, can be accessed at the 
following internet site: http://dqo.pnl.gov/VSP/Index.htm<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The following paragraphs provide an example of sampling and analysis requirements, 
using a systematic grid sampling approach, with randomly selected sample locations 
within each grid (also known as unaligned grid).  This example also includes 
a field analysis component for pre-compliance testing.  This is only an example 
of sampling and analysis requirements.  Compliance testing requirements are 
project specific, and usually based on negotiations with regulatory officials.</NPR><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Pre-Compliance Sampling Design</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  In the sample design shown in these paragraphs, one of the purposes of 
pre-compliance testing is to determine the variability of the data (i.e., standard 
deviation).  The variability of the data is then used to determine the minimum 
number of samples (i.e., maximum grid-size) that will be required for confirmatory 
sampling via the One-Sample t-Test.  Typical, default assumptions include: that 
the data is normally distributed, and that the clean-up goals have not been 
met (assume site is dirty).  An example of using the One-Sample t-Test to determine 
the minimum, required number of samples is shown on page 3-8 of the following 
reference:  Guidance for Data Quality Assessment, EPA QA/G-9, EPA/600/R-96/084.  
The same calculation can be performed using the Visual Sampling Plan software 
program (see http://dqo.pnl.gov/VSP/Index.htm ).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The grid size shown in this example was arbitrarily set at a maximum of 1000 
square meters (i.e., 4 grids per acre).  Grid sizing is a function of the variability 
of the data, and the statistical criteria that will be used to demonstrate attainment 
of clean-up criteria.  As the grid size increases, the required number of grids 
(and samples) decrease.  Larger grid sizes may be allowable for data that exhibits 
low variability.  An estimate of data variability should be used to arrive at 
the grid size (and number of samples) for pre-compliance sampling.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Based on landfarming project experience at "wood treater" sites in EPA Region 
8, about 10-12 samples per treatment cell are usually needed to meet the statistical 
requirements to show that clean-up goals were met.  Thus, the default number 
in this paragraph was set at a minimum of 8 samples.  It may be necessary to 
perform additional sampling and analysis, if the One-Sample t-Test indicates 
that too few samples were collected.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The default specified by this paragraph is for composite sampling within each 
grid.  Relative to discrete sampling, compositing provides a better measure 
of the mean contaminant level at a given number of analyses.  Discrete sampling 
is useful for assessing variability within the treatment cell.  A round of discrete 
sampling is recommended during treatment of the first one or two lifts of soil 
to assess the effectiveness of the Contractor's mixing (i.e., tilling) practices.  
Discrete sampling would typically involve sampling from one randomly selected 
location per grid.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>To determine pre-compliance sampling locations, the treatment cell must be divided into grids of equal area.

<BRK/>
Determination of the minimum number of samples will be dependent on the data 
variability.  Data from discrete samples will usually exhibit a greater degree 
of variability than data from composite samples.  A data set produced from discrete 
samples may result in more samples being required to demonstrate attainment 
of treatment criteria, relative to a data set produced from composite samples.  
Thus, the determination of the required, minimum number of confirmatory samples 
will be influenced by whether data from discrete (or composite) samples was 
used.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
At one Superfund project, lifts of treated soil were overlain by a new lifts 
of contaminated material, gradually increasing the height of the treatment cell, 
as each lift was treated.  This decreased material handling requirements, as 
the treatment cell location served as the final disposal site.  However, such 
a plan may also require monitoring to determine if contaminants are migrating 
into and re-contaminating the treated material.<BRK/>

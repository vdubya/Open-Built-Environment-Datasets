PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation 
are for [Contractor Quality Control approval.] [information only.  When used, a designation following the "G"

source for any size aggregate after the original source was tested, the cost of that additional testing will 
be borne by the Contractor.  Tests to which aggregate may be subjected are listed in paragraph QUALITY OF AGGREGATES

Government's test data and other information on aggregate quality of those sources listed at the end of this

based on compliance with 7-day lime-pozzolan strength requirements and other physical and chemical 
and uniformity requirements for which tests can be completed by the time the 7-day lime-pozzolan 
strength test is completed.  Release for shipment and approval for use on the above basis will 
be contingent on continuing compliance with the other requirements of the specifications.  If 
a bin fails, the contents may be resampled and tested at the Contractor's expense.  In this 
event, the pozzolan may be sampled as it is loaded into cars, trucks, or barges provided they 
are kept at the source until released for shipment.  Unsealing and resealing of bins and sealing 
of shipping conveyances will be done by or under the supervision of the Government.  Shipping 
conveyances will not be accepted at the site of the work unless received with all seals intact.  
If pozzolan is damaged in shipment, handling, or storage, it shall be promptly removed from 
the site of the work.  Pozzolan that has not been used within 6 months after testing shall be 
retested at the expense of the Contractor when directed by the Contracting Officer and shall 
be rejected if the test results are not satisfactory.  If tested pozzolan is rehandled at transfer

<NPR>NOTE:  This note may be disregarded for regions where Alkali-Silica Reactivity 
(ASR) is not a concern.  Some aggregate sources may exhibit an ASR potential.  
ASR is a potentially deleterious reaction between alkalis present in concrete 
and some siliceous aggregates, reference EM 1110-2-2000 paragraph 2-3b(6) and 
appendix D.  Where ASR is known or suspected to pose a concern for concrete 
durability, it is recommended that aggregates proposed for use in concrete be 
evaluated to determine ASR potential and an effective mitigation.  EM 1110-2-2000, 
provides recommendations for evaluating and mitigating ASR in concrete mixtures.  
Aggregate evaluations may not be practical for projects requiring small quantities 
of concrete (less than<MET> 200 cubic meters</MET><ENG> 250 cubic yards</ENG>).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> CONCRETE PAVING FOR AIRFIELDS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY PAVEMENTS, 
paragraph Alkali-Silica Reactivity, provides a specification method for the 
Contractor to evaluate and mitigate ASR in concrete mixtures.  The expansion 
limits specified in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> are requirements for pavements and exterior 
slab construction.  For structural concrete applications the measured expansion 
shall be less than 0.10 percent.  It may not be economical or practical to specify 
different test limit requirements for use on the same project.  In which case 
the lower limit required by the application should be used.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The designer may use the specification method in Section <SRF>32 13 14.13</SRF> by incorporating 
the relevant paragraphs into this specification, or may use the following requirements 
(retain either the 0.10 or the 0.08 percent expansion limits as appropriate) 
included in the paragraph below.  Delete the following paragraph if not required 
in the project.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>Alkali-Silica Reactivity:  Fine and coarse aggregates proposed for use in concrete shall be tested and evaluated 
for alkali-aggregate reactivity in accordance with <RID>ASTM C1260</RID>.  The fine and coarse aggregates shall be evaluated 
separately and in combination, matching the Contractor's proposed mix design proportioning.  All results of the 
separate and combination testing shall have a measured expansion less than 0.10 (0.08) percent at 16 days after 
casting.  Should the test data indicate an expansion of 0.10 (0.08) percent or greater, the aggregate(s) shall 
be rejected or additional testing using <RID>ASTM C1260</RID> and <RID>ASTM C1567</RID> shall be performed.  The additional testing

granulated blast furnace (GGBF) slag, or Class F fly ash.  GGBF slag shall be used in the range of 40 to 50 percent

<TXT>Before starting to mix and pump grout, disconnect the grout hoses from inserts or from inlet points and flush

the grout delivery lines disconnected at the inserts, grout shall be pumped and wasted until grout exiting the 
line is the same uniform consistency as that being discharged from the mixer.  The coarse aggregate within the 
forms shall be in a moist condition at the time of intrusion.  The intrusion shall be started at the lowest point 
in the aggregate.  All pumping shall be done uniformly and at the rate that will permit the grout to fill all 
voids and avoid displacing the aggregate.  After being discharged into the agitator tank, each batch of grout 
shall be continuously agitated until that batch is fully discharged into the pump.  Grout insert pipes shall 
be properly arranged and spaced to ensure a relatively level uniform grout surface.  Initially the outlet end 
of the intrusion lines shall penetrate the aggregate mass to within<MET> 50 mm</MET><ENG> 2 inches</ENG> of the base of the aggregate, 
unless otherwise directed.  The outlets shall be raised as the grout rises, and after grouting has progressed

means shall be provided for venting the underside of embedded projections with procedures previously submitted 
in accordance with paragraph SUBMITTALS.  Grouting shall be continued until grout of the specified quality is 
returned from the vent pipes, thereby indicating completeness of grout injection.  During the intrusion procedure, 
the forms shall be externally vibrated in the vicinity of the grout surface.  Sounding wells or other approved 
means of accurately locating the grout surface without interrupting the intrusion procedure shall be provided 
for observation and regulation of the level of the grout.  Agitation of grout shall be continuous during any 
shutdown of the intrusion procedure.  When there is a lapse in the operation of intrusion in excess of 15 minutes, 
the grout shall be recirculated through the pump, or agitator and pump.  The grout delivery lines shall be flushed 
with clean water if they become blocked.  They shall be disconnected from grout insert pipe before the flushing 
operation is performed and shall not be reconnected to grout insert pipe after flushing until pumping is resumed 
and grout appears.  In no case shall grout be used after appreciable stiffening of the grout mixture has occurred.  
[When placed underwater, intrusion shall begin while aggregates are being placed and shall follow closely behind 
aggregate placement unless otherwise approved.  At no time shall the grout surface be brought closer than<MET> 300

<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification also provides guidelines/recommendations for 
cleanup of lead, cadmium and chromium on construction projects impacting material 
containing lead, cadmium and chromium or lead based paint.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Obtain project specific information and appropriate sampling of Paint 
with Lead (PWL) or Material Containing Lead (MCL) that will be removed or disturbed.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification can be used in projects where LBP/PWL must be 
removed/controlled (including paint film stabilization) or lead-based paint 
hazards abated as defined by Public Law 102-550 Title X - Residential Lead-Based 
Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. Local requirements may be substantially 
restrictive for the conduction of LBP or LBP hazard abatement projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification should be used with all of the requirements 
of 40 CFR 745 (or state/local requirements in states with authorized programs) 
for projects involving lead-based paint hazard abatement in target housing and 
child occupied facilities being transferred or resolving facility-related work 
due to an occupant child with an elevated blood lead.  In these projects, it 
is required that the specification editor has appropriate training regarding 
lead-based paint activities.  Certification as a project designer per 40 CFR 
745 is required.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The classification of the lead-based paint or paint with lead as hazardous 
waste must be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 261, and in the design phase 
of the project.  This classification is prerequisite to the requirement of special 
handling, storage, and disposal according to Federal, state and local hazardous 
waste management regulations.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  When historic preservation work will disturb PWL, refer to the Secretary 
of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and Brief 
37, "Appropriate Methods for Reducing Lead-Paint Hazards in Historic Housing" 
as appropriate.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The work may involve a historic property. The designer must coordinate 
review of the proposed work with the appropriate cultural resources manager 
(CRM) and cultural resource laws and regulations, as part of the environmental 
review and permitting process.  Consultation with stakeholders, including the 
state historic preservation office, may be required, and work involving historic 
properties will likely be required to confirm to the Secretary of the Interior's 
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (usually at the REHABILITATION 
level). See <URL>https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-<BRK/>
rehabilitation.htm</URL>.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Projects involving housing improvement, maintenance, or repair are not 
considered a lead-based paint hazard abatement action even if the effect of 
the work removes (or reduces) lead exposure potentials to the occupants.  However, 
appropriate precautions for protecting occupants and leaving the housing clean 
(clearance) after concluding any work disturbing lead must be considered.  Specific 
training and certification requirements (40 CFR 745 or authorized state program 
requirements) may not be necessary for all projects. However, it is strongly 
recommended that the specification editor have appropriate training regarding 
lead.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Projects that involve cutting, sawing, sanding, scraping, needle gunning, 
abrasive blasting, high temperature removal, of lead-based paint/paint with 
lead and paints containing cadmium and chromium materials may result in exposures 
in excess of OSHA limits.  Therefore, personal protective equipment should be 
used and controls implemented.  Institute worker protection controls as indicated 
in 29 CFR 1926.62, 29 CFR 1926.1126, 29 CFR 1926.1127 and herein.  Also, some 
work practices are prohibited for LBP/LBP hazard abatement (e.g., machine sanding, 
abrasive blasting) unless used with HEPA exhaust controls (see 40 CFR 745.227).</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  To assure protection of workers and proper disposal of lead, cadmium 
and chromium based paint, this guide specification is to be used together with 
Section <SRF>01 35 26</SRF> GOVERNMENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This guide specification is not to be used for removal of lead-based paint from 
hydraulic structures, steel structures, or other similar structures.  For these 
types of structures, the designer should use Section <SRF>09 97 02</SRF> PAINTING: HYDRAULIC 
STRUCTURES.</NPR><BRK/>

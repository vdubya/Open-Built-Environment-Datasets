<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Special requirements for handling RCRA wastes are not included in this 
guide specification.  However, composting may be appropriate for treatment of 
some RCRA hazardous wastes.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This guide specification was developed based on the use of composting to treat 
explosives-contaminated soil.  The same process is believed to be applicable 
for treatment of some other types of organic contaminants in soil (see paragraph 
Treatment Criteria and Criteria for Reuse of Composted Soil, below).  Bioremediation 
processes, such as composting, are usually considered innovative technologies, 
and may satisfy CERCLA/SARA considerations of innovation in remediation.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>An edited version of this Section may be used to solicit a request for proposal 
(RFP).  Use of an RFP approach may prevent the contract from being awarded to 
a Contractor that is not technically qualified.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  These paragraphs should be edited based on whether the contract will 
use lump sum, or unit prices.  If there is a separate Measurement and Payment 
Section, edited versions of these paragraphs should be inserted in that section.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the quantities of contaminated soils are well defined, payment may be based 
upon a lump sum structure.  However, it is usually more cost-effective to use 
a unit price structure when there is a significant degree of uncertainty in 
the amount of contaminated material.  When specifying a unit price structure 
for treatment, separate items should be provided in the Contract Price Schedule 
to cover any other work required.  Other work items include, but are not limited 
to: preparation of submittals, mobilization and demobilization, site preparation, 
construction of the treatment pad and run on/runoff controls, contact water 
treatment and disposal, sampling and testing, implementing health and safety 
requirements, and utilities.  Inclusion of separate items in the Contract Price 
Schedule for the above work tasks should result in a lower unit price for treatment.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Bench-Scale Testing</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Lump sum pricing is recommended for this item; however, bidders should 
be required to provide a unit cost amount for testing for chemical data.  This 
will provide a basis for payment for additional analytical costs, if it is determined 
that more testing will be required.  The following reference should be used 
to prepare the Bench-Scale Test Plan:  EPA 540/R-93-519a, Guidance for Conducting 
Treatability Studies Under CERCLA, Biodegradation Remedy Selection, 1993.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Payment for bench-scale testing will be a lump sum price for proper completion of specified tests.  The price 
must include the cost of labor, materials, equipment usage, utilities, and fuel for: [preparation of the Bench-Scale 
Test Plan] [collecting samples,] [sample shipment,] [pre-processing,] [process monitoring (including testing 
for chemical data),] [disposal of treated material,] [ancillary waste treatment and disposal,] [preparation of 
the Bench-Scale Test Report,] [and] [_____].  Costs for procurement and handling of amendments used in the compost 
must be included in the unit price for treatment.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Field Demonstration</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Prior to planning the field demonstration, bench-scale testing should 
be performed to arrive at a suitable recipe of amendments, and to determine 
if the contaminants of concern are amenable to composting in the site-specific 
soil matrix.  The field demonstration may either be conducted prior to the construction 
of the full-scale facilities, or conducted using the full-scale facilities and 
equipment.  Payment for the field demonstration should be covered by a separate 
lump sum item, or on a unit price that is separate from the unit price for full-scale 
treatment.  Because more intensive monitoring is usually required during the 
field demonstration, the unit price for the field demonstration will usually 
be higher than the unit price for full-scale treatment.  Testing for chemical 
data is not included as a component of the price in this paragraph.  The contract 
price schedule should include separate, unit price items for testing for chemical 
data.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the results of the field demonstration indicate that an extended treatment 
period (or other special measures) will be required to meet cleanup goals, it 
may become necessary to modify the bid item that covers treatment pricing for 
full-scale operations.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Payment for the field demonstration will be [by the contract unit price schedule for each cubic [<MET>meter</MET><ENG> yard</ENG>] 
[_____] treated during the field demonstration] [a lump sum price for proper completion of approved tests].  
The price must include the cost of labor, materials, equipment usage, utilities, and fuel for:  [excavation,] 
[hauling,] [stockpiling,] [pre-processing,] [operation, maintenance and process monitoring (not including testing 
for chemical data),] [disposal of treated material,] [ancillary waste treatment and disposal,] [preparation of 
Field Demonstration Report,] [and] [_____].  Costs for procurement and handling of amendments used in the compost 
must be included in the unit price for treatment.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Contaminated Soils Treatment Unit Price</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Except for equipment usage costs (e.g, rental), other equipment costs 
are not included as a component of the unit price for treatment in this paragraph; 
testing for chemical data is also not included in the unit price.  The contract 
price schedule should include separate, unit price items for testing for chemical 
data.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If unit price payment will be based on weight, dry weight should be specified 
and requirements should be included for moisture content testing so that dry 
weight can be determined.  However, surveys are usually required before and 
after excavation of contaminated material, so that excavation and backfilling 
can be paid for on the basis of in-place volume.  Thus, in some cases, it may 
be advantageous to pay for processing and treatment of soils using in-place 
volume as the pricing unit.  Payment may also be based on ex-situ volume, after 
the oversize materials have been separated from the soil.  Because of the bulking 
which usually occurs during excavation of soil, ex-situ volume will usually 
be about 30 percent greater than the in-situ volume.  If there is a substantial 
volume of oversize material, or if a substantial volume of excavated material 
will not require treatment, it may be advantageous to use ex-situ volume as 
the basis for payment.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Payment for composting treatment of contaminated material must be by the contract unit price schedule for each 
cubic [<MET>meter</MET><ENG> yard</ENG>] [_____] based on [ex-situ volume, after separation of oversize material] [_____].  This unit 
price must include the cost of labor, materials, equipment usage, utilities, and fuel for:  [excavation,] [hauling,] 
[stockpiling,] [pre-processing,] [operation, maintenance and process monitoring (not including testing for chemical 
data),] [disposal of treated material,] [ancillary waste treatment and disposal,] [preparation of operations 
reports,] [and] [_____].  Costs for procurement and handling of amendments used in the compost must be included 
in the unit price for treatment.  After each batch has been treated, the quantity of material that does not meet 
treatment criteria must be reported and subtracted from the quantity of material comprising the batch, when determining 
payment for treatment.  Payment will not be made for material that does not meet treatment criteria.  If additional 
tests, or additional processing and testing, are necessary to show that material meets treatment criteria, the 
additional costs must be borne by the Contractor.</TXT><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Composting Treatment Pad</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Siting of the treatment facility should be in accordance with regulatory 
requirements.  The prevailing wind direction and the potential for odor generation 
should also be taken into consideration.  The design of the treatment pad and 
weather cover should include provisions for control of storm water and contact 
water, and should take into account the expected wheel loads of material handling 
equipment.  Concrete pads are typically more expensive, though less permeable 
than asphalt pads.  Asphalt pads have been used for hazardous waste composting 
projects.  It may also be necessary to construct asphalt pads for the following 
areas:  soils pre-processing area; and the amendment and soil blending area.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Pavement of the treatment pad must be in accordance with Sections [<SRF>32 12 16</SRF> HOT-MIX ASPHALT (HMA) FOR ROADS.] 
[<SRF>03 30 00</SRF> CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE.]  The treatment pad must be designed to withstand operation of material handling 
equipment, and to prevent infiltration of contact water.  The slope of the surface of the treatment pad must 
be not less than [2 percent] [_____].  Water collection channels must be incorporated into the paved treatment 
pad, and the pad must drain, by gravity, to collection sumps.  The water collection system and sump must be in 
accordance with paragraph Contact Water Management System and Design Storm, below.  Sloping, placement of collection 
channels, and sump must be sufficient to prevent ponding in the treatment pad area.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Treatment Pad Sizing</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The dimensions of the treatment pad should be based on the amount of 
time required to reach cleanup goals for each batch of compost (including laboratory 
turn-around time for compliance testing), the amount of time allotted for treatment 
of the contaminated soil (within the contract schedule), the "per-batch amount" 
of material that will be composted, the bulk density of the compost and soil, 
windrow dimensions and spacing, and the type of material handling equipment 
that will be used.  A batch is defined as that amount of material, including 
soil and amendments, for which treatment is initiated at the same time during 
full-scale operations.  After cleanup goals have been met for contaminants of 
concern, it may be necessary to continue to cure the compost (see paragraph 
Curing and Storage, in PART 3).  The compost may be moved to a separate area 
for curing.  On a previous composting project for explosives, each batch required 
about 4 weeks on the treatment pad (about 2 weeks treatment time, plus about 
2 weeks to receive laboratory data from confirmation samples).  Curing was not 
required on this project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Formulas for the areas of typical windrow cross sections are provided in NRAES-54.  
The bulk density of compost will vary depending on what amendments are used 
and the proportions of soil and amendments (see paragraph Amendments, in PART 
2).  See paragraph Windrow Construction, in PART 3 for information on windrow 
dimensions.  Use of long, narrow treatment pads may allow windrow mixing equipment 
to process a greater volume of material using a minimal number of turn-arounds.  
Thus long, narrow treatment pads may result in a more efficient operation than 
a wider treatment pad.  It may be economically advantageous for the Contractor 
to divide the treatment pad into separate areas, so that mixing equipment does 
not set idle:  on a portion of the pad, daily mixing of windrows may continue 
until definitive field analysis indicates that the compost is ready for compliance 
testing; on the other portion of the pad, the windrows may be allowed to set 
static while waiting for laboratory data from compliance testing.</NPR><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Storage Volume</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Typically, storage and testing of contact water is required prior to 
discharge.  Thus contact water storage facilities should be sized to contain 
the peak detention volume for the design storm.  In order to minimize treatment 
and disposal costs, it is often desirable to reuse the contact water to irrigate 
windrows.  If this approach is applied, the storage volume must be sufficient 
to retain the volume of water in storage prior to the design storm, and the 
volume of water generated by the design storm.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Sources of contact water include:  water from decontamination of equipment, 
personnel, and PPE; and runoff water from storage, preprocessing and treatment 
areas.  If the storage, preprocessing, and treatment areas are properly covered, 
then the amount of contact water resulting from precipitation events should 
be limited.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Although it is possible for contact water to accumulate compounds (e.g., 
acids, bases, or salts) at levels which may inhibit microbial activity, contact 
water may, typically, be applied to contaminated soil or compost with little 
or no treatment.  Water which has accumulated excessive levels of acids, bases 
or salts may require treatment and/or offsite disposal.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Contact water must be reused to the maximum extent in order to minimize the need for new makeup water and to 
limit the treatment, discharge and offsite disposal of wastewater.  Prior to reuse, contact water must be tested 
in accordance with paragraph Contact Water Testing, in PART 3 and must meet the requirements of paragraph Water 
Supply, in PART 2.  Prior to disposal, contact water that cannot be applied to contaminated soil or compost must 
be collected and tested in accordance with paragraph Treatment Criteria for Contact Water, below.  Process sludge 
(resulting from the removal of suspended material in the contact water) must be treated to meet the requirements 
of paragraph [Treatment Criteria for Other Waste, below] [Treatment Criteria for Composted Soil, below] [_____].</TXT><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Water may be added at many different points in the process:  to the raw 
materials prior to blending; during blending of amendments, before soil has 
been added; during the initial blending of compost; and during turning of the 
compost windrows.  Mixing equipment may be equipped with spray nozzles for applying 
water.  Timely irrigation of compost is critical during thermophilic stages 
of composting, when the highest rates of evaporation occur.  In arid climates, 
water usage rates will obviously be higher than in non-arid climates.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Although "breathable", water resistant cover material is available, direct 
contact between the covering material and the compost should be avoided.  Clam-shell 
buildings, metal buildings, pole barns, large tents, or other prefabricated 
structures may serve as weather covers.  The section containing requirements 
for the weather cover (e.g., Section <SRF>13 34 19</SRF> PREENGINEERED METAL BUILDINGS), 
should include the design snow load, maximum wind speed, soil bearing capacity, 
seismic parameters in accordance wirh UFC 3-310-04, maximum and minimum ambient 
air temperatures.  The interior of the weather cover should be suitable for 
a high water-vapor environment.  Metal surfaces may be subject to corrosive 
conditions.  If the composting will be conducted inside of an enclosed structure, 
adequate ventilation must be provided.  A rate of 3 to 6 air changes per hour 
has been recommended for composting facilities.  Carbon dioxide is generated 
and oxygen may become depleted during composting.  Ammonia gas is commonly generated 
as well.  It is also possible for methane to be generated, if anaerobic conditions 
are allowed to develop.  To ensure that proper and consistent ventilation requirements 
are specified, this section should be coordinated with other sections; e.g.,

<NPR>NOTE:  Some types of nonvolatile and semi-volatile organic contaminants are 
believed to be amenable to composting, including some explosives, polynuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, as found in creosote), and some pesticides and 
herbicides (see Engineering Bulletin, Composting, EPA 540/S-96/502; also, see 
The Science of Composting, by Epstein, 1997).  Since temperatures may exceed<MET>
 65 degrees C</MET><ENG> 150 degrees F</ENG> during composting, the volatility of contaminants 
of concern should be taken into consideration (see paragraph Temperature in 
PART 3).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Depending on regulatory requirements, both total concentration and leachability 
concentrations for some compounds may be required.  Total concentrations can 
be used to estimate worst case leachate concentrations.  If the contaminated 
material is classified as characteristic waste, leachability testing will usually 
be required, and the appropriate leachability test (e.g., EPA Synthetic Precipitation 
Leachate Procedure (SPLP) or EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure 
(TCLP)) must be selected.  If the treated material will not be disposed of in 
a landfill, SPLP testing may be appropriate.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Although there are EPA Land Application regulations for metals and pathogens 
(40 CFR 503 - Standards for Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge), these regulations 
are not normally applicable to hazardous waste composting (see paragraph Criteria 
for Reuse of Composted Soil, below).  Treatment criteria, and criteria for reuse 
should be in accordance with Federal, state and local regulations.  Prior approval 
by regulatory representatives should be acquired for treatment criteria values.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For those parent compounds for which partial breakdown products (intermediates) 
have been defined and analytical standards are readily available, it may be 
necessary to include testing for key intermediates.  A compound should not be 
targeted for analysis unless there is a defensible basis for including the compound.</NPR><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The land application or beneficial use of the compost will be largely 
controlled by existing land disposal restrictions (40 CFR 268), specifically 
toxicity characteristics for RCRA metals, volatiles, and semi-volatiles and 
any triggered universal treatment standards (40 CFR 268.48).  While the metals 
loading rates found in 40 CFR 503 - Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage 
Sludge (i.e. 40 CFR 503.13 - Pollutant limits) may be useful in evaluating beneficial 
use alternatives, the designer is cautioned that the scope of this standard 
is for domestic sewage sludge.  Composted materials may not meet this definition, 
and therefore would not be excluded from hazardous waste management regulations.  
The application of ceiling values listed in 40 CFR 503.13 to finished compost 
not excluded from hazardous waste regulations, is not allowed under regulation 
(40 CFR 503.6).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Although reductions in concentrations of heavy metals may occur due to dilution 
(through addition of amendments), composting is usually not considered a treatment 
process for inorganics.  However, depending on regulatory requirements and intended 
end use, it may be necessary to require testing for some inorganic parameters, 
for pathogens, and to include requirements to ensure that the compost has been 
properly cured (see paragraph Curing and Storage, in PART 3).  Toxicological 
testing of treated and untreated material was previously performed as part of 
a treatability study (see Characterization of Explosives Processing Waste Decomposition 
Due to Composting AEC TIC #4078, prepared for USATHAMA by Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory, Nov. 1991); however, toxicity testing is usually not required during 
full-scale operations.  The treatment criteria shown below are only examples.  
This paragraph should be edited to include site-specific criteria.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Prior to final disposition, the compost must meet the following criteria to determine if it has been properly 
cured:  1)  Minimum and maximum pH [5.0] [_____] and [7.6] [_____], respectively.  2)  The increase in temperature 
observed during the Dewar self-heating test must be not more than [15] [_____] degrees C above the ambient temperature; 
and the ambient temperature must not be greater than 25 degrees C.  3)  The soluble salt concentration (conductivity) 
of the finished compost must be less than [20] [_____] mmhos per centimeter.  4)  Dewar self-heating testing, 
and conductivity testing must be performed in accordance with paragraph Non-Standard Sampling and Analysis, in 
PART 3.  5)  The treated material must meet the criteria shown in Table 2.</TXT><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Factors driving selection of amendments should include:  seasonal availability, 
proximity of sources to the site, costs, amenability to storage and handling, 
moisture content, odor potential, texture and porosity, carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) 
ratio, previous experience with using an amendment, and variability in the quality 
of an amendment.  Amendment mixtures that have been successfully used for previous 
projects, involving treatment of hazardous-waste-contaminated soil, should be 
given primary consideration.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Theoretically, the C:N ratio of the compost recipe should be between 20:1-40:1.  
The C and N contents of candidate amendments can be estimated using literature 
values (see Appendix A of the On-Farm Composting Handbook).  Laboratory testing, 
for moisture and ash content, may also be used to determine carbon content.  
By subtracting the ash content from the dry weight, the organic matter content 
can be determined.  The carbon content is usually determined by dividing the 
organic matter content by 1.8.  Other amendment selection considerations are 
provided in paragraph Amendment Testing and Bench-Scale Testing, in PART 3.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the bulk density of the amendment recipe (not including soil) is greater 
than<MET> 640 kg per cubic meter</MET><ENG> 40 lbs per cubic foot</ENG>, the recipe may not be sufficiently 
porous.  Wood chips may be used to increase the porosity of a compost recipe; 
however, depending on plans for end-use, large-diameter materials may have to 
be separated from the finished material (see paragraphs SOIL PRE-PROCESSING, 
Curing and Storage, and Disposal in PART 3).  It becomes more difficult to maintain 
aerobic conditions in the windrow as the porosity decreases, and as the moisture 
content increases (see paragraph Moisture Control in PART 3).  Use of amendments 
with a extremely high moisture content (e.g., liquid manure) should be avoided.  
The moisture content of the soil and amendments will control the initial moisture 
content of the compost.  If the initial moisture content is too high, the windrow 
may not heat up properly, and the process may fail.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The following amendment mixture has been successfully used for full-scale treatment 
of explosives-contaminated soil:  30 percent soil, 17.5 percent sawdust, 17.5 
percent hay, 21 percent cow manure, 10.5 percent chopped potato waste, 3.5 percent 
chicken manure (as reported in USAEC CETHA-TS-CR-93043).  Based on previous, 
successful composting projects for explosives-contaminated soil, the following 
recipe of soil and amendments is recommended:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a.  30 percent Contaminated Soil.  It may be necessary to reduce the soil percentage 
if clayey soils are being treated.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>b.  15 - 20 percent Saw Dust/Wood Chips.  It may be advantageous to substitute 
all or a portion of the sawdust with wood chips.  Wood chips provide for greater 
porosity in the compost.  Use of cedar chips, or other aromatic wood chips, 
should be avoided.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>c.  15 - 17 percent Alfalfa Hay.  The quality of the hay may be marginal.  Moldy 
alfalfa hay has been found to perform satisfactorily, and it is usually less 
expensive than feed quality hay.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>d.  10 - 20 percent Potato Waste.  Chopped potatoes are better than whole potatoes.  
It may be possible to use other starch sources in lieu of potatoes.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>e.  15 - 25 percent Manure.  Must be fresh (not dried).   Although chicken manure 
has a higher nitrogen content, satisfactory results have been obtained using 
only cow or steer manure.  Manure from ruminant animals (e.g., cows) is thought 
to be the best source of microbial inoculum.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>If the treatment criteria is not achieved, implement corrective action at no additional cost.  The corrective 
action may include:  additional sampling to provide more data points for statistical analysis; or continued treatment.  
If there are portions of compost for which substantial reduction of contaminants of concern was not observed 
after the end of the estimated treatment period, prepare a report detailing all activities associated with those 
portions of the compost.  The report must include:  probable causes as to why significant reductions were not 
observed; measures that will be implemented to prevent the same problems from recurring; and a proposed plan 
for continued treatment of those portions of the compost where treatment criteria were not met.  Obtain written 
approval from the Contracting Officer prior to implementing measures that deviate from the Composting Work Plan.  
Continue monitoring (at no additional cost, and in accordance with paragraphs OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND PROCESS 
MONITORING, above), until the treatment criteria is attained.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Curing and Storage</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The dimensions of the curing and storage area should be based on the 
amount of time required for curing, the amount of time that cured compost will 
remain in storage, and the dimensions of curing and storage piles.  The volume 
of treated material will usually be less than the initial volume of the compost 
(see paragraph Disposal, below).  The compost is usually allowed to cure until 
after the following has been observed:  the high temperature (43 to 65 degrees 
C) stage of the process has been completed; the temperature has fallen back 
to about 38 degrees C or less; and the windrows no longer heat-up after turning.  
The On-Farm Composting Handbook recommends curing for at least one month.  Immature, 
or improperly cured compost may be detrimental to plants.  Properly cured compost 
should have no objectionable odor.  Although it is usually unnecessary to turn 
compost during curing, the compost should remain aerobic.  Thus, the size of 
the piles should be limited.  During curing and storage, the potential for spontaneous 
combustion and development of anaerobic conditions (or souring) increases as 
the dimensions of the compost piles increase.  On a previous composting project, 
a cellulose tackifying agent was used to prevent the wind from dispersing treated 
compost.  Only readily biodegradable tackifying agents should be used.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The slope of the surface of the areas for curing and storage must be not less than [2 percent] [_____].  The 
surfaces of areas for curing and storage must be well drained, and kept free of standing water at all times.  
If anaerobic conditions develop during curing or storage, the compost must be remixed, spread on a covered, dry 
surface, and allowed to aerate for at least 24 hours before reforming the piles.</TXT><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Depending upon the characteristics and quantities, the potential disposal 
scenarios for wastes may include:  onsite treatment and backfilling; partial 
onsite backfill and partial offsite disposal; and offsite disposal.  Asphalt 
surfaces may be removed and sent offsite for recycling.  One disposal scenario 
for each type of waste should be clearly defined.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>After treatment, a volume decrease of approximately 50 percent may be observed 
for compost that originally contained 30 percent soil and 70 percent amendments.  
If the compost will be applied as a soil amendment, the following indices should 
meet quality guideline standards:  pH, the Dewar self-heating test, conductivity, 
maximum particle size, foreign material content, and the levels of heavy metals.  
In addition, the plan for final disposition of the compost should take into 
account the conductivity, maximum particle size, foreign material content, and 
the levels of heavy metals in the untreated soil to assess if the final product 
will be suited for the desired end use.  See the On-Farm Composting Handbook 
for more on quality guidelines for different end uses of compost; also, see 
paragraph Treatment Criteria and Criteria for Reuse of Composted Soil, in PART 
1.  According to the On-Farm Composting Handbook, if the end use for compost 
will be as a soil amendment, the compost application rate should not exceed<MET> 
4 cubic meters per 110 square meters</MET> <ENG>4 cubic yards per 1000 square feet</ENG>.</NPR><BRK/>

<TXT>Demobilization must restore the site to its initial state, prior to the construction and operation of the composting 
treatment facilities.  Demobilization must not commence until written approval is received from the Contracting 
Officer.  Demobilization must include, but must not be limited to:  [removal of structures and materials used 
to house or cover the compost piles,] [disconnecting of utility service lines,] [decontamination and removal 
of equipment and materials,] [disposal of decontamination wastes,] [disposal of any residual wastewater,] [removal 
of unused amendments and other materials,] [removal of material overlying liners,] [removal of liners,] [regrading 
and removal of berms,] [demolition and disposal of the treatment pad, other foundation slabs, and paved surfaces,]

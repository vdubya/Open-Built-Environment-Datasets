<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Use the information provided in this note and ACI 546R to select the 
suitable type and size of impact breakers allowed on the project (bullet point 
b and c). Note that you can include different types and sizes of breakers for 
a job and specify where each should be used. Using large breakers increases 
the potential for microcracking, and that is why a suitable size (or limits) 
should be specified.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Hand-held breakers (chipping hammers): size ranges from 8 to 90 lbs (3.5 to 
41 kg). Smaller hand-held breakers are commonly used in partial depth removal 
of sound and unsound concrete and concrete removal around reinforcing steel 
because they minimize damage to the existing concrete and reinforcing steel. 
Larger breakers are used for removal of large volumes of concrete. For example, 
a 14 kg (30 lbs) breaker can be specified for removal of concrete above reinforcing 
steel while a smaller 7 kg (15 lbs)  hammer can be specified to remove concrete 
around reinforcing steel. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
Boom-mounted breakers: is like the hand-held breaker except that it is mechanically 
operated and considerably larger than a handheld breaker. Boom-mounted breakers 
differ from hand-held breakers as they function on the principle of high energy 
and low frequency rather than low energy and high frequency, and are driven 
by compressed air or hydraulic pressure. The reach of the hydraulic arm enables 
the breaker to be used on vertical or overhead surfaces at a considerable distance 
above and below the machine level.<BRK/>
The boom-mounted breaker is a highly productive means of removing concrete; 
however, the high-cycle impact energy delivered to a structure by the breaker 
generates forces that may damage the existing concrete and reinforcing steel 
and adversely affect the integrity of the structure. <BRK/>
For boom-mounted breakers, limits specified are based on energy not weight (example 
205 N-m or 150 ft-lbs).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Milling methods can remove a specified amount of concrete from large areas of 
horizontal or vertical surfaces. The removal depth typically ranges from 1/4 
to 4 in. (6 to 100 mm). Removal depth is determined by the number and size of 
teeth. Milling operations typically leave a sound surface with fewer microfractures 
than impact methods. <BRK/>
Rotary head milling equipment is used for uniform depth removal on horizontal 
or vertical surfaces. Boom-mounted milling head are used typically for vertical surfaces.<BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Bond Breakers</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Bond breakers are used as separator layers between existing concrete 
and overlays in unbonded overlay construction. The performance of unbonded resurfacing 
of concrete pavements depends largely upon obtaining effective separation between 
the two pavements. Because unbonded resurfacing is generally for concrete pavements 
in a more advanced state of deterioration, distresses in the underlying pavement 
can reflect through the resurfacing and compromise its performance if not addressed. 
To minimize the effect of the distresses in the underlying pavement on the performance 
of the unbonded resurfacing, a separator layer is placed so that the two pavements 
act independently of each other. It may be less expensive and enhance longevity 
to simply fill low spots with concrete in the resurfacing process. A wide variety 
of materials have been used as separator layers, including polyethylene sheeting, 
wax-based curing compounds, liquid asphalts, and hot-mix asphalt materials. 
The most common successful used separator layer is 1 in. (2.5 cm) of asphalt. 
Less than 1 in. (2.5 cm) thick asphaltic separator layers, such as slurry seals, 
have worked well in some cases, but are generally not recommended because they 
do not eliminate mechanical interlock, they erode near the joints, and they 
do not effectively separate the two layers. Polyethylene sheeting and curing 
compounds are also not recommended. They do not prevent working cracks from 
reflecting through the resurfacing and they trap moisture in the concrete, which 
may accelerate freeze-thaw damage. Typically, a fine-graded asphalt surface 
mixture has been used for the separator layer. On most pavements, a nominal 
1 in. (2.5 cm) thick layer provides adequate coverage over irregularities in 
the existing pavement. The thickness could be slightly increased when irregularities 
are large enough to impact placement operations. The separator layer does not 
provide significant structural enhancement; therefore, the placement of an excessively 
thick layer should be avoided. <BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Epoxy injection is a structural repair of the concrete. Epoxy resin is 
a thermosetting polymer that cures when mixed with a catalyzing agent or hardener. 
Once cured, epoxies have exceptional physical properties. Epoxies are recognized 
for their superior bond strength to concrete, which typically exceeds the tensile 
strength of normal concrete. Epoxies are used to repair cracks that typically 
range from 0.002 to 0.25 in. (0.05 to 6 mm) wide. Epoxy resin should only be 
used in nonmoving or dormant cracks. Reference ACI RAP-1, ICRI 210.1R, and ACI

<NPR>NOTE:  The primary objective of this repair is to fill the crack and structurally 
bond the concrete on both sides of the crack. This repair is to seal cracks 
that are not moving. By penetrating and filling the cracks, the resin can form 
a polymer plug that seals the crack, keeping out water, chlorides, carbon dioxide, 
sulfates, and other aggressive liquids and gases. This repair can only be applied 
to horizontal concrete elements such as slabs. The two most common polymer materials 
used for gravity feed crack repairs are epoxies and high molecular weight methacrylates 
(HMWM); more information on material selection is given in PRODUCTS. Use sand 
if a skid-resistant surface is desired or grind for a smooth surface. Reference

Overlays are typically bonded or unbonded. If the surface is not properly designed

due to unplanned bonded and unbonded areas. For this reason, it is important

overlay as well as the type of material used should be accounted for in the

Per ACI 224R and ACI 302.1R, unbonded overlays are used where severe cracking 
is present in the base, where cracking can later develop, or when contamination 
of the existing slab prevents complete bond with the overlay. Unbonded overlays 
are not used to strengthen existing slabs and must be sufficiently thick to 
resist loads on their own. Per ACI 302.1R, unbonded overlays should have a minimum 
thickness of 3 in. (75 mm) for foot-traffic, and a minimum thickness of 4 in. 
(100 mm) if the surface is to be subjected to vehicular traffic. Because of 
the thickness requirements, unbonded overlays are usually portland cement concrete
